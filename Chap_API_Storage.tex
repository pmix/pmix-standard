\provisionalChapter{Storage Support Definitions}
\label{chap:api_storage}

Distributed and parallel computing systems are increasingly embracing storage hierarchies to meet the diverse data management needs of applications and other systems software in a cost-effective manner.
These hierarchies provide access to a number of distinct storage layers, with each potentially composed of different storage hardware (e.g., HDD, SSD, tape, PMEM), deployed at different locations (e.g., on-node, on-switch, on-site, WAN), and designed using different storage paradigms (e.g., file-based, object-based).
Each of these systems offers unique performance and usage characteristics that storage system users should carefully consider to ensure the most efficient use of storage resources.

PMIx enables users to better understand storage hierarchies by defining attributes that formalize storage system characteristics, state, and other parameters.
These attributes can be queried by applications, I/O libraries and middleware, and workflow systems to discover available storage resources and to inform on which resources are most suitable for different I/O workload requirements.

\provisionalSection{Storage support constants}
\declarestruct{pmix_storage_medium_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_storage_medium_t}~\provisionalMarker{} is a \code{uint64_t} type that defines a set of bit-mask flags for specifying different types of storage mediums. These can be bitwise OR'd together to accommodate storage systems that mix storage medium types.

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalueProvisional{PMIX_STORAGE_MEDIUM_UNKNOWN}{0x0000000000000001}
The storage medium type is unknown.
%
\declareconstitemvalueProvisional{PMIX_STORAGE_MEDIUM_TAPE}{0x0000000000000002}
The storage system uses tape media.

\declareconstitemvalueProvisional{PMIX_STORAGE_MEDIUM_SSD}{0x0000000000000008}

%
\end{constantdesc}

\adviceimplstart
PMIx implementations should maintain the same ordering for bit-mask values for \refstruct{pmix_storage_medium_t} struct as provided in this standard, since these constants are ordered to provide semantic information that may be of use to PMIx users. Namely, \refstruct{pmix_storage_medium_t} constants are ordered in terms of increasing medium bandwidth.

It is further recommended that implementations should try to allocate empty bits in the mask so that they can be extended to account for new constant definitions corresponding to new storage mediums.
