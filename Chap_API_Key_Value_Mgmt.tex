\chapter{Key/Value Management}
\label{chap:api_kv_mgmt}

Management of key-value pairs in \ac{PMIx} is a distributed responsibility. While the stated objective of the \ac{PMIx} community is to eliminate collective operations, it is recognized that the traditional method of publishing/exchanging data must be supported until that objective can be met. This method relies on processes to discover and publish their local information which is collected by the local PMIx server library.
Global exchange of the published information is then executed via a collective operation performed by the host \ac{SMS} servers.

Keys are required to be unique within a specific level of informarion as defined in \ref{api:struct:attributes:retrieval}. For example, a value for \refattr{PMIX_NUM_NODES} can be specified for each of the \refterm{session}, \refterm{job}, and \refterm{application} levels. However, subsequently specifying another value for that attribute in the \refterm{session} level will overwrite the prior value.

Returns \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} or a negative value corresponding to a PMIx error constant.

%%%%
\descr

Push a value into the client's namespace.
The client's \ac{PMIx} library will cache the information locally until \refapi{PMIx_Commit} is called.

The provided \refarg{scope} is passed to the local PMIx server, which will distribute the data to other processes according to the provided scope.
The \refstruct{pmix_scope_t} values are defined in \specrefstruct{pmix_scope_t}.
Specific implementations may support different scope values, but all implementations must support at least \code{PMIX_GLOBAL}.

The \refstruct{pmix_value_t} structure supports both string and binary values.
PMIx implementations will support heterogeneous environments by properly converting binary values between host architectures, and will copy the provided \refarg{value} into internal memory.

\adviceimplstart
The PMIx server library will properly pack/unpack data to accommodate heterogeneous environments. The host \ac{SMS} is not involved in this action. The \refarg{value} argument must be copied - the caller is free to release it following return from the function.
\adviceimplend

\adviceuserstart
The value is copied by the PMIx client library. Thus, the application is free to release and/or modify the value once the call to \refapi{PMIx_Put} has completed.

Note that keys starting with a string of ``\code{pmix}'' are exclusively reserved for the \ac{PMIx} standard and must not be used in calls to \refapi{PMIx_Put}. Thus, applications should never use a defined ``PMIX_'' attribute as the key in a call to \refapi{PMIx_Put}.

%%%%
\descr

Retrieve information for the specified \refarg{key} as published by the process identified in the given \refstruct{pmix_proc_t}, returning a pointer to the value in the given address.

This is a blocking operation - the caller will block until either the specified data becomes available from the specified rank in the \refarg{proc} structure or the operation times out should the \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} attribute have been given.
The caller is responsible for freeing all memory associated with the returned \refarg{value} when no longer required.

The \refarg{info} array is used to pass user requests regarding the get operation.

\adviceuserstart
Information provided by the \ac{PMIx} server at time of process start is accessed by providing the namespace of the job with the rank set to \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD}. The list of data referenced in this way is maintained on the \ac{PMIx} web site at \url{https://pmix.org/support/faq/wildcard-rank-access/} but includes items such as the number of processes in the namespace (\refattr{PMIX_JOB_SIZE}), total available slots in the allocation (\refattr{PMIX_UNIV_SIZE}), and the number of nodes in the allocation (\refattr{PMIX_NUM_NODES}).

Data posted by a process via \refapi{PMIx_Put} needs to be retrieved by specifying the rank of the posting process. All other information is retrievable using a rank of \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD} when the information being retrieved refers to something non-rank specific (e.g., number of processes on a node, number of processes in a job), and using the rank of the relevant process when requesting information that is rank-specific (e.g., the \ac{URI} of the process, or the node upon which it is executing). Each subsection of Section \ref{api:struct:attributes} indicates the appropriate rank value for referencing the defined attribute.

\subsection{Accessing information: examples}
\label{chap:api_kv:getex}

This section provides examples illustrating methods for accessing information at various levels. The intent of the examples is not to provide comprehensive coding guidance, but rather to illustrate how \refapi{PMIx_Get} can be used to obtain information on a \refterm{session}, \refterm{job}, \refterm{application}, process, and node.

\subsubsection{Session-level information}

The \refapi{PMIx_Get} \ac{API} does not include an argument for specifying the \refterm{session} associated with the information being requested. Information regarding the session containing the requestor can be obtained by the following methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item for session-level attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_UNIV_SIZE}), specifying the requestor's namespace and a rank of \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD}; or
\item for non-specific attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_NUM_NODES}), including the \refattr{PMIX_SESSION_INFO} attribute to indicate that the session-level information for that attribute is being requested
\end{itemize}

Example requests are shown below:

\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}
pmix_info_t info;
pmix_value_t *value;
pmix_status_t rc;
pmix_proc_t myproc, wildcard;

/* initialize the client library */
PMIx_Init(&myproc, NULL, 0);

/* get the #slots in our session */
PMIX_PROC_LOAD(&wildcard, myproc.nspace, PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD);
rc = PMIx_Get(&wildcard, PMIX_UNIV_SIZE, NULL, 0, &value);

/* get the #nodes in our session */
PMIX_INFO_LOAD(&info, PMIX_SESSION_INFO, NULL, PMIX_BOOL);
rc = PMIx_Get(&wildcard, PMIX_NUM_NODES, &info, 1, &value);
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

Information regarding a different session can be requested by either specifying the namespace and a rank of \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD} for a process in the target session, or adding the \refattr{PMIX_SESSION_ID} attribute identifying the target session. In the latter case, the \refarg{proc} argument to \refapi{PMIx_Get} will be ignored:

\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}
pmix_info_t info[2];
pmix_value_t *value;
pmix_status_t rc;
pmix_proc_t myproc;
uint32_t sid;

/* initialize the client library */
PMIx_Init(&myproc, NULL, 0);

/* get the #nodes in a different session */
sid = 12345;
PMIX_INFO_LOAD(&info[0], PMIX_SESSION_INFO, NULL, PMIX_BOOL);
PMIX_INFO_LOAD(&info[1], PMIX_SESSION_ID, &sid, PMIX_UINT32);
rc = PMIx_Get(&myproc, PMIX_NUM_NODES, info, 2, &value);
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

\subsubsection{Job-level information}

Information regarding a job can be obtained by the following methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item for job-level attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_JOB_SIZE} or \refattr{PMIX_JOB_NUM_APPS}), specifying the namespace of the job and a rank of \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD} for the \refarg{proc} argument to \refapi{PMIx_Get}; or
\item for non-specific attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_NUM_NODES}), including the \refattr{PMIX_JOB_INFO} attribute to indicate that the job-level information for that attribute is being requested
\end{itemize}

Example requests are shown below:

\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}
pmix_info_t info;
pmix_value_t *value;
pmix_status_t rc;
pmix_proc_t myproc, wildcard;

/* initialize the client library */
PMIx_Init(&myproc, NULL, 0);

/* get the #apps in our job */
PMIX_PROC_LOAD(&wildcard, myproc.nspace, PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD);
rc = PMIx_Get(&wildcard, PMIX_JOB_NUM_APPS, NULL, 0, &value);

/* get the #nodes in our job */
PMIX_INFO_LOAD(&info, PMIX_JOB_INFO, NULL, PMIX_BOOL);
rc = PMIx_Get(&wildcard, PMIX_NUM_NODES, &info, 1, &value);
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend


\subsubsection{Application-level information}

Information regarding an application can be obtained by the following methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item for application-level attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_APP_SIZE}), specifying the namespace and rank of a process within that application;
\item for application-level attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_APP_SIZE}), including the \refattr{PMIX_APPNUM} attribute specifying the application whose information is being requested. In this case, the namespace field of the \refarg{proc} argument is used to reference the \refterm{job} containing the application - the \refterm{rank} field is ignored;
\item or application-level attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_APP_SIZE}), including the \refattr{PMIX_APPNUM} and \refattr{PMIX_NSPACE} or \refattr{PMIX_JOBID} attributes specifying the job/application whose information is being requested. In this case, the \refarg{proc} argument is ignored;
\item for non-specific attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_NUM_NODES}), including the \refattr{PMIX_APP_INFO} attribute to indicate that the application-level information for that attribute is being requested
\end{itemize}

Example requests are shown below:

\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}
pmix_info_t info;
pmix_value_t *value;
pmix_status_t rc;
pmix_proc_t myproc, otherproc;
uint32_t appsize, appnum;

/* initialize the client library */
PMIx_Init(&myproc, NULL, 0);

/* get the #processes in our application */
rc = PMIx_Get(&myproc, PMIX_APP_SIZE, NULL, 0, &value);
appsize = value->data.uint32;

/* get the #nodes in an application containing "otherproc".
 * Note that the rank of a process in the other application
 * must be obtained first - a simple method is shown here */

/* assume for this example that we are in the first application
 * and we want the #nodes in the second application - use the
 * rank of the first process in that application, remembering
 * that ranks start at zero */
PMIX_PROC_LOAD(&otherproc, myproc.nspace, appsize);

PMIX_INFO_LOAD(&info, PMIX_APP_INFO, NULL, PMIX_BOOL);
rc = PMIx_Get(&otherproc, PMIX_NUM_NODES, &info, 1, &value);

/* alternatively, we can directly ask for the #nodes in
 * the second application in our job, again remembering that
 * application numbers start with zero */
appnum = 1;
PMIX_INFO_LOAD(&appinfo[0], PMIX_APP_INFO, NULL, PMIX_BOOL);
PMIX_INFO_LOAD(&appinfo[1], PMIX_APPNUM, &appnum, PMIX_UINT32);
rc = PMIx_Get(&myproc, PMIX_NUM_NODES, appinfo, 2, &value);

\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

\subsubsection{Process-level information}

Process-level information is accessed by providing the namespace and rank of the target process. In the absence of any directive as to the level of information being requested, the \ac{PMIx} library will always return the process-level value.

\subsubsection{Node-level information}

Information regarding a node within the system can be obtained by the following methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item for node-level attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_NODE_SIZE}), specifying the namespace and rank of a process executing on the target node;
\item for node-level attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_NODE_SIZE}), including the \refattr{PMIX_NODEID} or \refattr{PMIX_HOSTNAME} attribute specifying the node whose information is being requested. In this case, the \refarg{proc} argument's values are ignored; or
\item for non-specific attributes (e.g., \refattr{PMIX_MAX_PROCS}), including the \refattr{PMIX_NODE_INFO} attribute to indicate that the node-level information for that attribute is being requested
\end{itemize}

Example requests are shown below:

\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}
pmix_info_t info[2];
pmix_value_t *value;
pmix_status_t rc;
pmix_proc_t myproc, otherproc;
uint32_t nodeid;

/* initialize the client library */
PMIx_Init(&myproc, NULL, 0);

/* get the #procs on our node */
rc = PMIx_Get(&myproc, PMIX_NODE_SIZE, NULL, 0, &value);

/* get the #slots on another node */
PMIX_INFO_LOAD(&info[0], PMIX_NODE_INFO, NULL, PMIX_BOOL);
PMIX_INFO_LOAD(&info[1], PMIX_HOSTNAME, "remotehost", PMIX_STRING);
rc = PMIx_Get(&myproc, PMIX_MAX_PROCS, info, 2, &value);

\end{codepar}

%%%%
\descr

This is an asynchronous operation.
The \ac{PRI} will immediately return to the caller while the data is transmitted to the local server in the background.

\adviceuserstart
The local PMIx server will cache the information locally - i.e., the committed data will not be circulated during \refapi{PMIx_Commit}.
Availability of the data upon completion of \refapi{PMIx_Commit} is therefore implementation-dependent.

\adviceimplend

%%%%
\descr

Passing a \code{NULL} pointer as the \refarg{procs} parameter indicates that the fence is to span all processes in the client's namespace.
Each provided \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} struct can pass \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD} to indicate that all processes in the given namespace are participating.

The \refarg{info} array is used to pass user requests regarding the fence operation.

Note that for scalability reasons, the default behavior for \refapi{PMIx_Fence} is to not collect the data.

\adviceimplstart
\refapi{PMIx_Fence} and its non-blocking form are both \emph{collective} operations. Accordingly, the \ac{PMIx} server library is required to aggregate participation by local clients, passing the request to the host environment once all local participants have executed the \ac{API}.
\adviceimplend

\advicermstart
The host will receive a single call for each collective operation. It is the responsibility of the host to identify the nodes containing participating processes, execute the collective across all participating nodes, and notify the local \ac{PMIx} server library upon completion of the global collective.

Note that \ac{PMIx} libraries may choose to implement an optimization for the case where only the calling process is involved in the fence operation by immediately returning \refconst{PMIX_OPERATION_SUCCEEDED} from the client's call in lieu of passing the fence operation to a \ac{PMIx} server. Fence operations involving more than just the calling process must be communicated to the \ac{PMIx} server for proper execution of the included barrier behavior.

Similarly, fence operations that involve only processes that are clients of the same \ac{PMIx} server may be resolved by that server without referral to its host environment as no inter-node coordination is required.

Note that the function will return an error if a \code{NULL} callback function is given.

Note that for scalability reasons, the default behavior for \refapi{PMIx_Fence_nb} is to not collect the data.

\reqattrstart
\ac{PMIx} libraries are not required to directly support any attributes for this function. However, any provided attributes must be passed to the host \ac{SMS} daemon for processing, and the \ac{PMIx} library is \textit{required} to add the \refPRIAttributeItem{PMIX_USERID} and the \refPRIAttributeItem{PMIX_GRPID} attributes of the client process that published the info.

The following attributes are optional for host environments that support this operation:

\pastePRRTEAttributeItem{PMIX_TIMEOUT}
\pastePRRTEAttributeItem{PMIX_RANGE}
\pastePRRTEAttributeItem{PMIX_PERSISTENCE}

\optattrend

\adviceimplstart
We recommend that implementation of the \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} attribute be left to the host environment due to race condition considerations between completion of the operation versus internal timeout in the \ac{PMIx} server library. Implementers that choose to support \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} directly in the \ac{PMIx} server library must take care to resolve the race condition and should avoid passing \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} to the host environment so that multiple competing timeouts are not created.
\adviceimplend

%%%%
\descr

Publish the data in the \refarg{info} array for subsequent lookup.
By default, the data will be published into the \refconst{PMIX_SESSION} range and with \refconst{PMIX_PERSIST_APP} persistence.
Changes to those values, and any additional directives, can be included in the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} array. Attempts to access the data by processes outside of the provided data range will be rejected. The persistence parameter instructs the server as to how long the data is to be retained.

The blocking form will block until the server confirms that the data has been sent to the \ac{PMIx} server and that it has obtained confirmation from its host \ac{SMS} daemon that the data is ready to be looked up. Data is copied into the backing key-value data store, and therefore the \refarg{info} array can be released upon return from the blocking function call.

\adviceuserstart
Duplicate keys within the specified data range may lead to unexpected behavior depending
on host RM implementation of the backing key-value store.
\adviceuserend

\adviceimplstart
Implementations should, to the best of their ability, detect duplicate keys and protect the
user from unexpected behavior - preferably returning an error. This version of the
standard does not define a specific error code to be returned, so the implementation must
make it clear to the user what to expect in this scenario. One suggestion is to define an RM
specific error code beyond the \refconst{PMIX_EXTERNAL_ERR_BASE} boundary. Future versions of the standard
will clarify that a specific \ac{PMIx} error be returned when conflicting values are published for a given
key, and will provide attributes to allow modified behaviors such as overwrite.

\descr

Lookup information published by this or another process.
By default, the search will be conducted across the \refconst{PMIX_SESSION} range.
Changes to the range, and any additional directives, can be provided in the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} array.

Note that the search is also constrained to only data published by the current user (i.e., the search will not return data published by an application being executed by another user).
There currently is no option to override this behavior - such an option may become available later via an appropriate \refstruct{pmix_info_t} directive.

The \argref{data} parameter consists of an array of \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} struct with the keys specifying the requested information.
Data will be returned for each key in the associated \refarg{value} struct.
Any key that cannot be found will return with a data type of \refconst{PMIX_UNDEF}.
The function will return \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} if any values can be found, so the caller must check each data element to ensure it was returned.

The proc field in each \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} struct will contain the namespace/rank of the process that published the data.

\adviceuserstart
Although this is a blocking function, it will not wait by default for the requested data to be published.
Instead, it will block for the time required by the server to lookup its current data and return any found items.
Thus, the caller is responsible for ensuring that data is published prior to executing a lookup, using \refattr{PMIX_WAIT} to instruct the server to wait for the data to be published, or for retrying until the requested data is found.
