\chapter{Publish/Lookup Operations}
\label{chap:pub}

Chapter~\ref{chap:api_rsvd_keys} and Chapter~\ref{chap:nrkeys} discussed how reserved and non-reserved keys dealt with
information that either was associated with a specific process (i.e., the
retrieving process knew the identifier of the process that posted it) or
required a synchronization operation prior to retrieval (e.g., the case of
globally unique non-reserved keys). However, another requirement exists for an
asynchronous exchange of data where neither the posting nor the retrieving
process is known in advance. For example, two separate namespaces may need to
rendezvous with each other without knowing in advance the identity of the other
namespace or when that namespace might become active.

The \acp{API} defined in this section focus on resolving that specific
situation by allowing processes to publish data that can subsequently be
retrieved solely by referral to its key. Mechanisms for constraining
availability of the information are also provided as a means for better
targeting of the eventual recipient(s).

Note that no presumption is made regarding how the published information is to be stored, nor as to the entity (host environment or \ac{PMIx} implementation) that shall act as the datastore. The descriptions in the remainder of this chapter shall simply refer to that entity as the \emph{datastore}.

There are no required attributes for this \ac{API}. \ac{PMIx} implementations that do not directly support the operation but are hosted by environments that do support it must pass any attributes that are provided by the client to the host environment for processing. In addition, the \ac{PMIx} library is required to add the \refAttributeItem{PMIX_USERID} and the \refAttributeItem{PMIX_GRPID} attributes of the client process that published the information to the \refarg{info} array passed to the host environment.

\descr

Publish the data in the \refarg{info} array for subsequent lookup.
By default, the data will be published into the \refconst{PMIX_RANGE_SESSION} range and with \refconst{PMIX_PERSIST_APP} persistence.
Changes to those values, and any additional directives, can be included in the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} array. Attempts to access the data by processes outside of the provided data range shall be rejected. The \refattr{PMIX_PERSISTENCE} attribute instructs the datastore holding the published information as to how long that information is to be retained.

The blocking form of this call will block until it has obtained confirmation from the datastore that the data is available for lookup. The \refarg{info} array can be released upon return from the blocking function call.

Publishing duplicate keys is permitted provided they are published to different
ranges. Duplicate keys being published on the same data range shall return the
\refconst{PMIX_ERR_DUPLICATE_KEY} error.

%%%%
\descr

Lookup information published by this or another process.
By default, the search will be constrained to publishers that fall within the \refconst{PMIX_RANGE_SESSION} range in case duplicate keys exist on different ranges.
Changes to the range (e.g., expanding the search to all potential publishers via the \refconst{PMIX_RANGE_GLOBAL} constant), and any additional directives, can be provided in the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} array. Data is returned per the retrieval rules of Section \ref{chap:pub:retrules}.

The \argref{data} parameter consists of an array of \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} structures with the keys specifying the requested information.
Data will be returned for each \code{key} field in the associated \code{value} field of this structure as per the above description of return values. The \code{proc} field in each \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} structure will contain the namespace/rank of the process that published the data.

\adviceuserstart
Although this is a blocking function, it will not wait by default for the requested data to be published.
Instead, it will block for the time required by the datastore to lookup its current data and return any found items.
Thus, the caller is responsible for either ensuring that data is published prior to executing a lookup, using \refattr{PMIX_WAIT} to instruct the datastore to wait for the data to be published, or retrying until the requested data is found.

\section{Retrieval rules for published data}
\label{chap:pub:retrules}

The retrieval rules for published data primarily revolve around enforcing data access permissions and range constraints. The datastore shall search its stored information for each specified key according to the following precedence logic:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the requester specified the range, then the search shall be constrained to data where the publishing process falls within the specified range.

    \item If the key of the stored information does not match the specified key, then the search will continue.

    \item If the requester's identifier does not fall within the range specified by the publisher, then the search will continue.

    \item If the publisher specified access permissions, the effective \ac{UID} and \ac{GID} of the requester shall be checked against those permissions, with the datastore rejecting the match if the requester fails to meet the requirements.

    \item If all of the above checks pass, then the value is added to the information that is to be returned.
\end{enumerate}

The status returned by the datastore shall be set to:

\begin{itemize}
\item \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} All data was found and is included in the returned information.

\item \refconst{PMIX_ERR_NOT_FOUND} None of the requested data could be found within a requester's range.

\item \refconst{PMIX_ERR_PARTIAL_SUCCESS} Some of the requested data was found.
Only found data will be included in the returned information. Note that the specific reason for a particular piece of missing information (e.g., lack of permissions) cannot be communicated back to the requester in this situation.

\item a non-zero \ac{PMIx} error constant indicating a reason for the request's failure.
\end{itemize}

In the case where data was found and range restrictions were met for each specified key, but none of the matching data could be returned due to lack of access permissions, the datastore must return the  \refconst{PMIX_ERR_NO_PERMISSIONS} error.

\adviceuserstart
Note that duplicate keys are allowed to exist on different ranges, and that ranges do overlap each other. Thus, if duplicate keys are published on overlapping ranges, it is possible for the datastore to successfully find multiple responses for a given key should publisher and requester specify sufficiently broad ranges. In this situation, the choice of resolving the duplication is left to the datastore implementation - e.g., it may return the first value found in its search, or the value corresponding to the most limited range of the found values, or it may choose to simply return an error.

Users are advised to avoid this ambiguity by careful selection of key values and ranges - e.g., by creating range-specific keys where necessary.

However, any provided attributes must be passed to the host environment for processing, and the \ac{PMIx} library is required to add the \refAttributeItem{PMIX_USERID} and the \refAttributeItem{PMIX_GRPID} attributes of the client process that is requesting the operation.

\reqattrend

\optattrstart
The following attributes are optional for host environments that support this operation:

\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_TIMEOUT}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_RANGE}

\optattrend

%%%%
\descr

Unpublish data posted by this process using the given \refarg{keys}.
The function will block until the data has been removed by the server (i.e., it is safe to publish that key again within the specified range).
A value of \code{NULL} for the \refarg{keys} parameter instructs the server to remove all data published by this process.

By default, the range is assumed to be \refconst{PMIX_RANGE_SESSION}.
Changes to the range, and any additional directives, can be provided in the \refarg{info} array.

Returns one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS}, indicating that the request is being processed by the host environment - result will be returned in the provided \refarg{cbfunc}. Note that the library must not invoke the callback function prior to returning from the \ac{API}.
    \item \refconst{PMIX_OPERATION_SUCCEEDED}, indicating that the request was immediately processed and returned \textit{success} - the \refarg{cbfunc} will \textit{not} be called.
    \item a PMIx error constant indicating either an error in the input or that the request was immediately processed and failed - the \refarg{cbfunc} will \textit{not} be called.
