\chapter{Publish/Lookup Operations}
\label{chap:pub}

Chapter~\ref{chap:api_rsvd_keys}
and
Section ~\ref{chap:data_sharing:non_rsvd_keys}
present how reserved and non-reserved keys deal with
information that either is associated with a specific process (i.e., the
retrieving process knows the identifier of the process that posted it) or
requires a synchronization operation prior to retrieval (e.g., the case of
globally unique non-reserved keys). However, another requirement exists for an
asynchronous exchange of data where neither the posting nor the retrieving
process is known in advance (e.g. two namespaces that do not share a child-parent relationship).
The \acp{API} defined in this section focus on resolving that specific
situation by allowing processes to publish data that can subsequently be
retrieved solely by referral to its key. Mechanisms for constraining
the scope of availability of the information are also provided as a means for better
targeting of the eventual recipient(s).

Note that no presumption is made regarding how the published information is to be stored, nor as to the entity (host environment or \ac{PMIx} implementation) that shall act as the datastore. The descriptions in the remainder of this chapter shall simply refer to that entity as the \emph{datastore}.

%If the info array does not include a \refattr{PMIX_DATA_TO_PUBLISH} info,
%the implementation should
%distinguish between info array elements that specify keys and directives as follows:
%All standardized directives to the publish call,
%including optional attributes the implementation does not support,
%should be treated as
%directives.  Non-supported directives
%may be ignored as outlined in Section \ref{intro:portability:attributes},
%but should not be treated as data to
%publish.  The implementation may treat any custom (non-standardized) directives it
%supports as directives.  All other \refarg{info} array elements
%should be assumed to be data to be published.
%Since additional directives may be added to the standard and implementations may add support for additional custom directives, the use of \refattr{PMIX_DATA_TO_PUBLISH} is the only reliable way to ensure that
%future implementations will not mis-classify elements of an \refarg{info} array.

\declarestruct{pmix_data_range_t}

\versionMarker{1.0}
The \refstruct{pmix_data_range_t} structure is a \code{uint8_t} type that defines a range for data \textit{published} via the \refapi{PMIx_Publish} \ac{API} and events generated via the \refapi{PMIx_Notify_event}.
The following constants can be used to set a variable of the type \refstruct{pmix_data_range_t}.

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_RANGE_UNDEF}{0}

Data is intended for the host environment, or lookup is restricted to data published by the host environment.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_RANGE_LOCAL}{2}
Published data and generated events are restricted to processes on the same node as the publisher or event creator.  Lookup of data is restricted to data published by processes on the same node as the requester.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_RANGE_NAMESPACE}{3}

Lookup of data is restricted to data published by procesess in the same session as the requester.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_RANGE_GLOBAL}{5}
Published data and generated events are available to all processes within the domain of the host environment.
Lookup of data is unrestricted and open to data published by any processes within the domain of the host enivornment as the requester.  This range differs from \refconst{PMIX_RANGE_RM} only on systems which have mechanisms to share events and
publish/lookup data across multiple instances of a host environment.

\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_RANGE_INVALID}{UINT8_MAX}
Invalid value - typically used to indicate that a range has not yet been set.
%
\end{constantdesc}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data Persistence Structure}
\declarestruct{pmix_persistence_t}

\versionMarker{1.0}
The \refstruct{pmix_persistence_t} structure is a \code{uint8_t} type that defines the policy for data published by clients via the \refapi{PMIx_Publish} \ac{API}.
The following constants can be used to set a variable of the type \refstruct{pmix_persistence_t}.

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_PERSIST_INDEF}{0}
Retain data until unpublished.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_PERSIST_FIRST_READ}{1}

%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_PERSIST_PROC}{2}
Retain data until the publishing process terminates.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_PERSIST_APP}{3}
Retain data until the application terminates.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_PERSIST_SESSION}{4}
Retain data until the session/allocation terminates.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_PERSIST_INVALID}{UINT8_MAX}
Invalid value - typically used to indicate that a persistence has not yet been set.
%
\end{constantdesc}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Lookup Related Data Structures}

\declarestruct{pmix_pdata_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} structure is used both to request the lookup of keys and to describe the value and publishing process of any keys that were successfully retrieved.
A request to lookup published values is described by an array of \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} structures.
Only the key field is used in the lookup request.
The results of the lookup operation are returned in the same array with the proc and value fields set when the key is successfully found.
The value field's data type is set to \refconst{PMIX_UNDEF} in the associated \refarg{value} struct of any key which was not retrieved.

\} pmix_pdata_t;
}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{proc} is the process identifier of the data publisher.
    \item \emph{key} is the string key of the published data.

\descr

Lookup information published by a process or host environment using \refapi{PMIx_Publish} or \refapi{PMIx_Publish_nb}.
A lookup operation is always performed on a range which can be specified using the directive \refAttributeItem{PMIX_RANGE} or otherwise defaults to \refconst{PMIX_RANGE_SESSION}.

The lookup operation will be constrained to data published to the specified range.
Data is returned per the retrieval rules of Section \ref{chap:pub:retrules}.

The \argref{data} parameter consists of an array of \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} structures with the keys specifying the requested information.
Data will be returned for each \code{key} field in the associated \code{value} field of this structure as per the above description of return values. The \code{proc} field in each \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} structure will contain the namespace/rank of the process that published the data.

\adviceuserstart
Although this is a blocking function, it will not wait by default for the requested data to be published.
Instead, it will block for the time required by the datastore to lookup its current data and return any found items.
Thus, the caller is responsible for either ensuring that data is published prior to executing a lookup, using \refattr{PMIX_WAIT} to instruct the datastore to wait for the data to be published, or retrying until the requested data is found.

\section{Retrieval rules for published data}
\label{chap:pub:retrules}

The retrieval rules for published data primarily revolve around enforcing data access permissions and range constraints.
All publish and lookup operations operate on a range. If not specified, the range defaults to \refconst{PMIX_RANGE_SESSION}.
The key being looked up will match with a published key only if all of the following conditions are met:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The lookup key matches the published key.
    \item The type of range specified by the publisher is the same as the type of range specified by the requester.
    \item The requestor must be a member of the range specified by the publisher.
    \item The publisher must be a member of the range specified by the requestor.
    \item If the publisher specified access permissions, the effective \ac{UID} and \ac{GID} of the requester must meet those requirements.
\end{enumerate}

The status returned by the datastore shall be set to:

\begin{itemize}
\item \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} All data was found and is included in the returned information.

\item \refconst{PMIX_ERR_NOT_FOUND} None of the requested data could be found within a requester's range.

\item \refconst{PMIX_ERR_PARTIAL_SUCCESS} Some of the requested data was found.
Only found data will be included in the returned information. Note that the specific reason for a particular piece of missing information (e.g., lack of permissions) cannot be communicated back to the requester in this situation.

\item \refconst {PMIX_ERR_NO_PERMISSIONS} All requested data was found and range restrictions were met for each specified key, but none of the matching data could be returned due to lack of access permissions.

\item a non-zero \ac{PMIx} error constant indicating a reason for the request's failure.
\end{itemize}

\ac{PMIx} libraries are not required to directly support any attributes for this function. However, any provided attributes must be passed to the host environment for processing, and the \ac{PMIx} library is required to add the \refAttributeItem{PMIX_USERID} and the \refAttributeItem{PMIX_GRPID} attributes of the client process that is requesting the operation.

The following attributes are optional for host environments that support this operation:

\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_TIMEOUT}

%%%%
\descr

Unpublish a list of keys published by the calling process.
The function will block until the data has been removed by the server (i.e., it is safe to publish that key again within the specified range).
A value of \code{NULL} for the \refarg{keys} parameter instructs the server to remove all data published by this process.

By default, the range is assumed to be \refconst{PMIX_RANGE_SESSION}.
Changes to the range, and any additional directives, can be provided in the \refarg{info} array.
