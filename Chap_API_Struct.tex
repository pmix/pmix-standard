\chapter{Data Structures and Types}
\label{chap:struct}

This chapter defines \ac{PMIx} standard data structures (along with macros for convenient use), types, and constants.
These apply to all consumers of the \ac{PMIx} interface.
Where necessary for clarification, the description of, for example, an attribute may be copied from this chapter into a section where it is used.

A PMIx implementation may define additional attributes beyond those specified in this document.

\adviceimplstart
Structures, types, and macros in the \ac{PMIx} Standard are defined in terms of the C-programming language. Implementers wishing to support other languages should provide the equivalent definitions in a language-appropriate manner.

If a PMIx implementation chooses to define additional attributes they should avoid using the \code{"PMIX"} prefix in their name or starting the attribute string with a \code{"pmix"} prefix.
This helps the end user distinguish between what is defined by the PMIx standard and what is specific to that PMIx implementation, and avoids potential conflicts with attributes defined by the Standard.
\adviceimplend

\adviceuserstart
Use of increment/decrement operations on indices inside \ac{PMIx} macros is discouraged due to unpredictable behavior as the index may be cited more than once in
the macro. The \ac{PMIx} standard only governs the existence and syntax of macros - it does not specify their implementation.

Users are also advised to use the macros and \acp{API} for creating, loading, and releasing
\ac{PMIx} structures to avoid potential issues with release of memory. For
example, pointing a \refstruct{pmix_envar_t} element at a static string
variable and then using \refmacro{PMIX_ENVAR_DESTRUCT} to clear it would
generate an error as the static string had not been allocated.

\adviceuserend

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Constants}
\label{chap:struct:const}

\ac{PMIx} defines a few values that are used throughout the standard to set the size of fixed arrays or as a means of identifying values with special meaning.
The community makes every attempt to minimize the number of such definitions.
The constants defined in this section may be used before calling any \ac{PMIx} library initialization routine.
Additional constants associated with specific data structures or types are defined in the section describing that data structure or type.

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_MAX_NSLEN}{255}
Maximum namespace string length as an integer.
\end{constantdesc}

\adviceimplstart
Namespace arrays in \ac{PMIx} defined structures must reserve
a space of size \refconst{PMIX_MAX_NSLEN}+1 to allow room for the \code{NULL} terminator
\adviceimplend

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_MAX_KEYLEN}{511}
Maximum key string length as an integer.
\end{constantdesc}

\adviceimplstart
Key arrays in \ac{PMIx} defined structures must reserve
a space of size \refconst{PMIX_MAX_KEYLEN}+1 to allow room for the \code{NULL} terminator
\adviceimplend

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_APP_WILDCARD}{UINT32_MAX}
A value to indicate that the user wants the data for the given key from every application that posted that key, or that the given value applies to all applications within the given namespace.
\end{constantdesc}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{PMIx Return Status Constants}
\label{api:struct:errors}
\declarestruct{pmix_status_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_status_t} type is an \code{int} compatible value for return status values.
\ac{PMIx} return values other than \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} are required to always be negative.  The return status value for a successful operation is
\refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS}, which must have an integer value of 0:
 
\begin{constantdesc}
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_SUCCESS}{0}
Success.
\end{constantdesc}

\adviceimplstart
A \ac{PMIx} implementation must define all of the return status constants defined in the \ac{PMIx} standard, even if the implementation will never return the specific value to the caller.
\adviceimplend

\adviceuserstart
Other than \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} (which is required to be zero), the integer value of any \ac{PMIx} error constant are negative and of greater magnitude (i.e. of larger absolute value) than\refconst{PMIX_EXTERNAL_ERR_BASE}.
For compatibility with future versions, users are advised to always refer to constants by name, and not by their integer value which may be specific to an \ac{ABI} version.
\adviceuserend

The presentation of each \ac{API} in this document includes a list of return status constants which are either specific to that \ac{API} or are expected to be returned by the \ac{API} in normal use.

In addition, the following are general constants covering a variety of possible reasons an implementation of an \ac{API} may return a constant other than one of the constants presented with the \ac{API}.  Although implementations can define and return additional error constants, implementations are encouraged to return one of the return constants listed with the \ac{API} or in the list presented here to encourage portability across implementations. 

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERROR}{-1}
General Error.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_EXISTS}{-11}
The requested operation would overwrite an existing value - typically returned
when an operation would overwrite an existing file or directory.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_EXISTS_OUTSIDE_SCOPE}{-62}
The requested key exists, but was posted in a \emph{scope} (see Section \ref{api:nres:scope}) that does not include the requester

by the implementation.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH}{-18}
The data type found in an object does not match the expected data type
as specified in the \ac{API} call - e.g., a request to unpack a
\refconst{PMIX_BOOL} value from a buffer that does not contain a value of
that type in the current unpack location.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_UNPACK_INADEQUATE_SPACE}{-19}
Inadequate space to unpack data - the number of values in the buffer exceeds
the specified number to unpack.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_UNPACK_READ_PAST_END_OF_BUFFER}{-50}
Unpacking past the end of the provided buffer - the number of values in the
buffer is less than the specified number to unpack, or a request was made to
unpack a buffer beyond the buffer's end.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_UNPACK_FAILURE}{-20}
The unpack operation failed for an unspecified reason.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_PACK_FAILURE}{-21}

\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_UNREACH}{-25}
The specified target server or client process is not reachable - i.e., a
suitable connection either has not been or can not be made.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_BAD_PARAM}{-27}
One or more incorrect parameters (e.g., passing an attribute with a value of the wrong type), or multiple parameters containing conflicting directives (e.g., multiple instances of the same attribute with different values, or different attributes specifying conflicting behaviors), were passed to a \ac{PMIx} \ac{API}.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_EMPTY}{-60}
An array or list was given that has no members in it - i.e., the object is empty.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_RESOURCE_BUSY}{-28}
Resource busy - typically seen when an attempt to establish a connection
to another process (e.g., a \ac{PMIx} server) cannot be made due to a
communication failure.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_OUT_OF_RESOURCE}{-29}
Resource exhausted.

Communication failure - a message failed to be sent or received, but the
connection remains intact.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_LOST_CONNECTION}{-61}
Lost connection between server and client or tool.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_INVALID_OPERATION}{-158}
The requested operation is supported by the implementation and host environment, but fails to meet a requirement (e.g., requesting to \textit{disconnect} from processes without first \textit{connecting} to them, inclusion of conflicting directives, or a request to perform an operation that conflicts with an ongoing one).
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS}{-156}
A requested operation is already in progress - the duplicate request
shall therefore be ignored.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_OPERATION_SUCCEEDED}{-157}
The requested operation was performed atomically - no callback function will be executed.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_ERR_PARTIAL_SUCCESS}{-52}
The operation is considered successful but not all elements of the operation were concluded (e.g., some members of a group construct operation chose not to participate).
%
\end{constantdesc}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{User-Defined Error and Event Constants}
\label{api:struct:usererrors}

\ac{PMIx} establishes a boundary for constants defined in the \ac{PMIx} standard. Negative values larger (i.e., more negative) than this (and any positive values greater than zero) are guaranteed not to conflict with \ac{PMIx} values.

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_EXTERNAL_ERR_BASE}{-3000}
A starting point for user-level defined error and event constants.
Negative values that are more negative than the defined constant are guaranteed not to conflict with \ac{PMIx} values.
Definitions should always be based on the \refconst{PMIX_EXTERNAL_ERR_BASE} constant and not a specific value as the value of the constant may change.
%
\end{constantdesc}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Data Types}

This section defines various data types used by the \ac{PMIx} APIs. The version of the standard in which a particular data type was introduced is shown in the margin.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Key Structure}
\declarestruct{pmix_key_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_key_t} structure is a statically defined character array of length \refconst{PMIX_MAX_KEYLEN}+1, thus supporting keys of maximum length \refconst{PMIX_MAX_KEYLEN} while preserving space for a mandatory \code{NULL} terminator.

\copySignature{pmix_key_t}{2.0}{
typedef char pmix_key_t[PMIX_MAX_KEYLEN+1];
}

Characters in the key must be standard alphanumeric values supported by common utilities such as \textit{strcmp}.

\adviceuserstart
References to keys in \ac{PMIx} v1 were defined simply as an array of characters of size \code{PMIX_MAX_KEYLEN+1}. The \refstruct{pmix_key_t} type definition was introduced in version 2 of the standard. The two definitions are code-compatible and thus do not represent a break in backward compatibility.

Passing a \refstruct{pmix_key_t} value to the standard \textit{sizeof} utility can result in compiler warnings of incorrect returned value. Users are advised to avoid using \textit{sizeof(pmix_key_t)} and instead rely on the \refconst{PMIX_MAX_KEYLEN} constant.
\adviceuserend

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Key support macros}

The following macros are provided for convenience when working with \ac{PMIx} keys.

\littleheader{Check key macro}
\declaremacro{PMIX_CHECK_KEY}

}

\begin{arglist}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Namespace Structure}
\declarestruct{pmix_nspace_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_nspace_t} structure is a statically defined character array of length \refconst{PMIX_MAX_NSLEN}+1, thus supporting namespaces of maximum length \refconst{PMIX_MAX_NSLEN} while preserving space for a mandatory \code{NULL} terminator.

\copySignature{pmix_nspace_t}{2.0}{
typedef char pmix_nspace_t[PMIX_MAX_NSLEN+1];
}

Characters in the namespace must be standard alphanumeric values supported by common utilities such as \textit{strcmp}.

\adviceuserstart
References to namespace values in \ac{PMIx} v1 were defined simply as an array of characters of size \code{PMIX_MAX_NSLEN+1}. The \refstruct{pmix_nspace_t} type definition was introduced in version 2 of the standard. The two definitions are code-compatible and thus do not represent a break in backward compatibility.

Passing a \refstruct{pmix_nspace_t} value to the standard \textit{sizeof} utility can result in compiler warnings of incorrect returned value. Users are advised to avoid using \textit{sizeof(pmix_nspace_t)} and instead rely on the \refconst{PMIX_MAX_NSLEN} constant.
\adviceuserend

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Namespace support macros}

The following macros are provided for convenience when working with \ac{PMIx} namespace structures.

\littleheader{Check namespace macro}

\begin{arglist}
\argin{a}{Pointer to the structure whose value is to be checked (pointer to \refstruct{pmix_nspace_t})}
\end{arglist}

\littleheader{Load namespace macro}
\declaremacro{PMIX_LOAD_NSPACE}

Load a namespace into a \refstruct{pmix_nspace_t}.

\copySignature{PMIX_LOAD_NSPACE}{4.0}{

}

\begin{arglist}
\argin{a}{Pointer to the target structure (pointer to \refstruct{pmix_nspace_t})}

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_RANK_UNDEF}{UINT32_MAX}
A value to request job-level data where the information itself is not associated with any specific rank, or when passing a \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} identifier to an operation that only references the namespace field of that structure.

It contains a reference to the namespace and the \refstruct{pmix_rank_t} within that namespace.

\copySignature{pmix_proc_t}{1.0}{
typedef struct pmix_proc \{ \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Info Type Directives}
\declarestruct{pmix_info_directives_t}
\label{api:struct:infodirs}

\versionMarker{2.0}
The \refstruct{pmix_info_directives_t} structure is a \code{uint32_t} type that defines the behavior of command directives via \refstruct{pmix_info_t} arrays.
By default, the values in the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} array passed to a PMIx are \emph{optional}.

\adviceuserstart
A PMIx implementation or PMIx-enabled \ac{RM} may ignore any \refstruct{pmix_info_t} value passed to a \ac{PMIx} \ac{API} that it does not support or does not recognize if it is not explicitly marked as \refconst{PMIX_INFO_REQD}.
This is because the values specified default to optional, meaning they can be ignored in such circumstances.
This may lead to unexpected behavior when porting between environments or \ac{PMIx} implementations if the user is relying on the behavior specified by the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} value.
Users relying on the behavior defined by the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} are advised to set the \refconst{PMIX_INFO_REQD} flag using the \refmacro{PMIX_INFO_REQUIRED} macro.
\adviceuserend

\adviceimplstart
The top 16-bits of the \refstruct{pmix_info_directives_t} are reserved for internal use by \ac{PMIx} library implementers - the \ac{PMIx} standard will \textit{not} specify their intent, leaving them for customized use by implementers. Implementers are advised to use the provided \refmacro{PMIX_INFO_IS_REQUIRED} macro for testing this flag, and must return \refconst{PMIX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED} as soon as possible to the caller if the required behavior is not supported.
\adviceimplend

The following constants were introduced in version 2.0 (unless otherwise marked) and can be used to set a variable of the type \refstruct{pmix_info_directives_t}.

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_INFO_REQD}{0x00000001}
The behavior defined in the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} array is required, and not optional. This is a bit-mask value.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_INFO_REQD_PROCESSED}{0x00000004}
Mark that this required attribute has been processed. A required attribute can be handled at any level - the \ac{PMIx} client library might take care of it, or it may be resolved by the \ac{PMIx} server library, or it may pass up to the host environment for handling. If a level does not recognize or support the required attribute, it is required to pass it upwards to give the next level an opportunity to process it. Thus, the host environment (or the server library if the host does not support the given operation) must know if a lower level has handled the requirement so it can return a \refconst{PMIX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED} error status if the host itself cannot meet the request. Upon processing the request, the level must therefore mark the attribute with this directive to alert any subsequent levels that the requirement has been met.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_INFO_ARRAY_END}{0x00000002}
Mark that this \refstruct{pmix_info_t} struct is at the end of an array created by the \refmacro{PMIX_INFO_CREATE} macro. This is a bit-mask value.
%
\declareconstitemvalue{PMIX_INFO_DIR_RESERVED}{0xffff0000}
A bit-mask identifying the bits reserved for internal use by implementers - these currently are set as \code{0xffff0000}.
%
\end{constantdesc}

\advicermstart
Host environments are advised to use the provided \refmacro{PMIX_INFO_IS_REQUIRED} macro for testing this flag and must return \refconst{PMIX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED} as soon as possible to the caller if the required behavior is not supported.

\subsection{Environmental Variable Structure}
\declarestruct{pmix_envar_t}

\versionMarker{3.0}
Define a structure for specifying environment variable modifications.
Standard environment variables (e.g., \code{PATH}, \code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}, and \code{LD_PRELOAD})
take multiple arguments separated by delimiters. Unfortunately, the delimiters
depend upon the variable itself - some use semi-colons, some colons, etc. Thus,
the operation requires not only the name of the variable to be modified and
the value to be inserted, but also the separator to be used when composing
the aggregate value.
