\chapter{Fabric Support Definitions}
\label{chap:api_fabric}

As the drive for performance continues, interest has grown in both scheduling algorithms that take into account network locality of the allocated resources, and in optimizing collective communication patterns by structuring them to follow fabric topology. Several interfaces have been defined that are specifically intended to support \acp{WLM} (also known as \emph{schedulers}) by providing access to information of potential use to scheduling algorithms - e.g., information on communication costs between different points on the fabric.

In contrast, hierarchical collective operations require each process have global information about both its peers and the fabric. For example, one might aggregate the contribution from all processes on a node, then again across all nodes on a common switch, and finally across all switches. Creating such optimized patterns relies on detailed knowledge of the fabric location of each participant.

\ac{PMIx} supports these efforts by defining datatypes and attributes by which fabric coordinates for processes and devices can be obtained from the host \ac{SMS}. When used in conjunction with the \ac{PMIx} \emph{instant on} methods, this results in the ability of a process to obtain the fabric coordinate of all other processes without incurring additional overhead associated with the publish/exchange of that information.



\section{Fabric Support Constants}
\label{api:sched:consts}

The following constants are defined for use in fabric-related events.

\begin{constantdesc}

%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATE_PENDING}
The \ac{PMIx} server library has been alerted to a change in the fabric that requires updating of one or more registered \refstruct{pmix_fabric_t} objects.

%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATED}
The \ac{PMIx} server library has completed updating the entries of all affected \refstruct{pmix_fabric_t} objects registered with the library. Access to the entries of those objects may now resume.

%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_COORDS_UPDATED}
Fabric coordinates have been updated - the affected fabrics/planes are identified in the notification. Coordinates of processes and devices on those affected components should be refreshed prior to next use.

\end{constantdesc}

%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Fabric Support Datatypes}

Several datatype definitions have been created to support fabric-related operations and information.

\subsection{Fabric Coordinate Structure}
\declarestruct{pmix_coord_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_coord_t} structure describes the fabric coordinates of a specified process in a given view

\versionMarker{4.0}
\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}
typedef struct pmix_coord \{
    char *fabric;
    char *plane;
    pmix_coord_view_t view;
    uint32_t *coord;
    size_t dims;
\} pmix_coord_t;
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

All coordinate values shall be expressed as unsigned integers due to their units being defined in fabric devices and not physical distances. The coordinate is therefore an indicator of connectivity and not relative communication distance.

The fabric and plane fields are assigned by the fabric provider to help the user identify the fabric to which the coordinates refer. Note that providers are not required to assign any particular value to the fields and may choose to leave the fields blank. Example entries include \{"Ethernet", "mgmt"\} or \{"infiniband", "data1"\}.

\adviceimplstart
Note that the \refstruct{pmix_coord_t} structure does not imply nor mandate any requirement on how the coordinate data is to be stored within the \ac{PMIx} library. Implementers are free to store the coordinate in whatever format they choose.
\adviceimplend

A fabric coordinate is usually associated with a given fabric device - e.g., a particular \ac{NIC} on a node. Thus, while the fabric coordinate of a device must be unique in a given view, the coordinate may be shared by multiple processes on a node. If the node contains multiple fabric devices, then either the device closest to the binding location of a process shall be used as its coordinate, or (if the process is unbound or its binding is not known) all devices on the node shall be reported as a \refstruct{pmix_data_array_t} of \refstruct{pmix_coord_t} structures.

Nodes with multiple fabric devices can also have those devices configured as multiple \refterm{fabric planes}. In such cases, a given process (even if bound to a specific location) may be associated with a coordinate on each plane. The resulting set of fabric coordinates shall be reported as a \refstruct{pmix_data_array_t} of \refstruct{pmix_coord_t} structures. The caller may request a coordinate from a specific fabric plane by passing the \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_PLANE} attribute as a directive/qualifier to the \refapi{PMIx_Get} or \refapi{PMIx_Query_info_nb} call.

\subsection{Fabric Coordinate Support Macros}
\label{api:netcoord:macros}

The following macros are provided to support the \refstruct{pmix_coord_t} structure.

#define PMIX_COORD_PHYSICAL_VIEW    0x02
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

Fabric coordinates can be reported based on different \emph{views} according to user preference at the time of request. The following views have been defined:

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_COORD_VIEW_UNDEF}
The coordinate view has not been defined.
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_COORD_LOGICAL_VIEW}
The coordinates are provided in a \emph{logical} view, typically given in Cartesian (x,y,z) dimensions, that describes the data flow in the fabric as defined by the arrangement of the hierarchical addressing scheme, fabric segmentation, routing domains, and other similar factors employed by that fabric.
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_COORD_PHYSICAL_VIEW}
The coordinates are provided in a \emph{physical} view based on the actual wiring diagram of the fabric - i.e., values along each axis reflect the relative position of that interface on the specific fabric cabling.
%
\end{constantdesc}

\adviceimplstart
\ac{PMIx} library implementers are advised to avoid declaring the above constants as actual \code{enum} values in order to allow host environments to add support for possibly proprietary coordinate views.
\adviceimplend

If the requester does not specify a view, coordinates shall default to the \emph{logical} view.


\subsection{Fabric Link State}
\declarestruct{pmix_link_state_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_link_state_t} is a \code{uint32_t} type for fabric link states.

typedef uint8_t pmix_link_state_t;
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

The following constants can be used to set a variable of the type \refstruct{pmix_link_state_t}. All definitions were introduced in version 4 of the standard unless otherwise marked. Valid link state values start at zero.

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_REQUEST_INFO}
Request information on a specific fabric - if the fabric isn't specified as per \refapi{PMIx_Fabric_register}, then return information on the system default fabric. Information to be returned is described in \refstruct{pmix_fabric_t}.
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATE_INFO}

%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_GET_VERTEX_INFO}
Request information on a specific \ac{NIC} within the identified fabric - the index of the device (\refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_INDEX}) and of the fabric (\refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_INDEX}) must be provided. If the \ac{NIC} identifier is not specified, then return vertex info on all \acp{NIC} in the fabric. Information to be included on each vertex is described in \refstruct{pmix_fabric_t}.

\adviceuserstart
Requesting information on every \ac{NIC} in the fabric may be an expensive operation in terms of both memory footprint and time.
\adviceuserend
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_GET_DEVICE_INDEX}
Request the fabric-wide index (returned as \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_INDEX}) for a specific \ac{NIC} within the identified fabric based on the provided vertex information. The index of the fabric must be provided.
%
\end{constantdesc}


\subsection{Fabric registration structure}
\declarestruct{pmix_fabric_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_fabric_t} structure is used by a \ac{WLM} to interact with fabric-related \ac{PMIx} interfaces, and to provide information about the fabric for use in scheduling algorithms or other purposes.

\versionMarker{4.0}
\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}
typedef struct pmix_fabric_s \{
    char *name;
    size_t index;
    pmix_info_t *info;
    size_t ninfo;
    void *module;
\} pmix_fabric_t;;
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

Note that in this structure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \refarg{name} is an optional user-supplied string name identifying the fabric being referenced by this struct. If provided, the field must be a \code{NULL}-terminated string composed of standard alphanumeric values supported by common utilities such as \textit{strcmp}.;
    \item \refarg{index} is a \ac{PMIx}-provided number identifying this object;
    \item \refarg{info} is an array of \refstruct{pmix_info_t} containing information (provided by the \ac{PMIx} library) about the fabric;
    \item \refarg{ninfo} is the number of elements in the \refarg{info} array
    \item \refarg{module} points to an opaque object reserved for use by the \ac{PMIx} server library.
\end{itemize}

Note that only the \refarg{name} field is provided by the user - all other fields are provided by the \ac{PMIx} library and must not be modified by the user. The \refarg{info} array contains a varying amount of information depending upon both the \ac{PMIx} implementation and information available from the fabric vendor. At a minimum, it must contain (ordering is arbitrary):

\reqattrstart

\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_VENDOR}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_IDENTIFIER}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_NUM_VERTICES}

\reqattrend

\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_PLANE}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_SHAPE}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_SHAPE_STRING}

While unusual due to scaling issues, implementations may include an array of \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE} elements describing the vertex information for each \ac{NIC} in the system. Each element shall contain a \refstruct{pmix_data_array_t} of \refstruct{pmix_info_t} values describing the device. Each array may contain one or more of the following (ordering is arbitrary):

\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_NAME}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_VENDOR}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_ID}

\section{Fabric Support Functions}

The following \acp{API} allow the \ac{WLM} to request specific services from the fabric subsystem via the \ac{PMIx} library.

\advicermstart
Due to their high cost in terms of execution, memory consumption, and interactions with other \ac{SMS} components (e.g., a fabric manager), it is strongly advised that the underlying implementation of these \acp{API} be restricted to a single \ac{PMIx} server in a system that is supporting the \ac{SMS} component responsible for the scheduling of allocations (i.e., the system \refterm{scheduler}). The \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_SCHEDULER} attribute can be used for this purpose to control the execution path. Clients, tools, and other servers utilizing these functions are advised to have their requests forwarded to the server supporting the scheduler using the \refapi{pmix_server_fabric_fn_t} server module function, as needed.

\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_VENDOR}

\reqattrend

%%%%
\descr

Register for access to fabric-related information, including the communication cost matrix. This call must be made prior to requesting information from a fabric. The caller may request access to a particular fabric using the vendor, type, or identifier, or to a specific \refterm{fabric plane} via the \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_PLANE} attribute - otherwise, the default fabric will be returned.

For performance reasons, the \ac{PMIx} library does not provide thread protection for accessing the information in the \refstruct{pmix_fabric_t} structure. Instead, the \ac{PMIx} implementation shall provide two methods for coordinating updates to the provided fabric information:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Users may periodically poll for updates using the \refapi{PMIx_Fabric_update} \ac{API}

    \item Users may register for \refconst{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATE_PENDING} events indicating that an update to the cost matrix is pending. When received, users are required to terminate or pause any actions involving access to the cost matrix before returning from the event. Completion of the \refconst{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATE_PENDING} event handler indicates to the \ac{PMIx} library that the fabric object's entries are available for updating. This may include releasing and re-allocating memory as the number of vertices may have changed (e.g., due to addition or removal of one or more \acp{NIC}). When the update has been completed, the \ac{PMIx} library will generate a \refconst{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATED} event indicating that it is safe to begin using the updated fabric object(s).

\end{itemize}

There is no requirement that the caller exclusively use either one of these options. For example, the user may choose to both register for fabric update events, but poll for an update prior to some critical operation.

Returns one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS}, indicating return of a valid value.
    \item \refconst{PMIX_ERR_BAD_PARAM}, indicating that the provided index is out of bounds.
    \item a \ac{PMIx} error constant indicating either an error in the input or that the request failed.
\end{itemize}

\descr

Query information about a specified vertex (fabric device, or \ac{NIC}) in the system. The returned \refarg{status} indicates if requested data was found or not. The returned array of \refstruct{pmix_info_t} will contain information on the specified vertex - the exact contents will depend on the \ac{PMIx} implementation and the fabric vendor. At a minimum, it must contain sufficient information to uniquely identify the device within the system (ordering is arbitrary):

\reqattrstart
\pastePRIAttributeItemBegin{PMIX_HOSTNAME} The \refattr{PMIX_NODEID} may be returned in its place, or in addition to the hostname.
\pastePRIAttributeItemEnd
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_NAME}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_VENDOR}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_BUS_TYPE}
\pastePRIAttributeItemBegin{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_PCI_DEVID} This item should be included if the device bus type is \ac{PCI} - the equivalent should be provided for any other bus type.
\pastePRIAttributeItemEnd

\reqattrend

The returned array may optionally contain one or more of the following:

\optattrstart
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_ID}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_DRIVER}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_FIRMWARE}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_ADDRESS}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_MTU}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_SPEED}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_STATE}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_TYPE}
\optattrend

The caller is responsible for releasing the returned array.

\descr

Query the index number of a vertex corresponding to the provided description. The description must provide adequate information to uniquely identify the target vertex. At a minimum, this must include identification of the node hosting the device using either the \refattr{PMIX_HOSTNAME} or \refattr{PMIX_NODEID}, plus a node-level unique identifier for the device (e.g., the \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_PCI_DEVID} for a \ac{PCI} device).
