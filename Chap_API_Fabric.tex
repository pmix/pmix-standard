\chapter{Fabric Support Definitions}
\label{chap:api_fabric}

As the drive for performance continues, interest has grown in scheduling algorithms that take into account network locality of the allocated resources and in optimizing collective communication patterns by structuring them to follow fabric topology. In addition, concerns over the time required to initiate execution of parallel applications and enable communication across them have grown as the size of those applications extends into the hundreds of thousands of individual processes spanning tens of thousands of nodes.

\ac{PMIx} supports the communication part of these efforts by defining data types and attributes by which fabric endpoints and coordinates for processes and devices can be obtained from the host environment. When used in conjunction with other \ac{PMIx} methods described in Chapter \ref{chap:api_server}, this results in the ability of a process to obtain the fabric endpoint and coordinate of all other processes without incurring additional overhead associated with a global exchange of that information. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Defining several interfaces specifically intended to support \acp{WLM} by providing access to information of potential use to scheduling algorithms - e.g., information on communication costs between different points on the fabric.

	\item Supporting hierarchical collective operations by providing the fabric coordinates for all devices on participating nodes as well as a list of the peers sharing each fabric switch. This enables one, for example, to aggregate the contribution from all processes on a node, then again across all nodes on a common switch, and finally across all switches based on detailed knowledge of the fabric location of each participant.

	\item Enabling the "\refterm{instant on}" paradigm to mitigate the scalable launch problem by providing each process with a rich set of information about the environment and the application, including everything required for communication between peers within the application, at time of process start of execution.

\end{itemize}

Meeting these needs in the case where only a single fabric device exists on each node is relatively straightforward - \ac{PMIx} and the host environment provide a single endpoint for each process plus a coordinate for the device on each node, and there is no uncertainty regarding the endpoint each process will use. Extending this to the multiple device per node case is more difficult as the choice of endpoint by any given process cannot be known in advance, and questions arise regarding reachability between devices on different nodes. Resolving these ambiguities without requiring a global operation requires that \ac{PMIx} provide both (a) an endpoint for each application process on each of its local devices; and (b) the fabric coordinates of all remote and local devices on participating nodes. It also requires that each process open all of its assigned endpoints as the endpoint selected for contact by a remote peer cannot be known in advance.

While these steps ensure the ability of a process to connect to a remote peer, it leaves unanswered the question of selecting the \emph{preferred} device for that communication. If multiple devices are present on a node, then the application can benefit from having each process utilize its "closest" fabric device (i.e., the device that minimizes the communication distance between the process' location and that device) for messaging operations. In some cases, messaging libraries prefer to also retain the ability to use non-nearest devices, prioritizing the devices based on distance to support multi-device operations (e.g., for large message transmission in parallel).

\ac{PMIx} supports this requirement by providing the array of process-to-device distance information for each process and local fabric device at start of execution. Both minimum and maximum distances are provided since a single process can occupy multiple processor locations. In addition, since processes can relocate themselves by changing their processor bindings, \ac{PMIx} provides an \ac{API} that allows the process to dynamically request an update to its distance array.

However, while these measures assist a process in selecting its own best endpoint, they do not resolve the uncertainty over the choice of preferred device by a remote peer. There are two methods by which this ambiguity can be resolved:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item A process can select a remote endpoint to use based on its own preferred device and reachability of the peer's remote devices. Once the initial connection has been made, the two processes can exchange information and mutually determine their desired communication path going forward.

    \item The application can use knowledge of both the local and remote distance arrays to compute the best communication path and establish that connection. In some instances (e.g., a homogeneous system), a \ac{PMIx} server may provide distance information for both local and remote devices. Alternatively, when this isn't available, an application can opt to collect the information using the \refattr{PMIX_COLLECT_GENERATED_JOB_INFO} with the \refapi{PMIx_Fence} \ac{API}, or can obtain it on a one peer-at-a-time basis using the \refapi{PMIx_Get} \ac{API} on systems where the host environment supports the \refterm{Direct Modex} operation.

\end{enumerate}

Information on fabric coordinates, endpoints, and device distances are provided as \emph{reserved keys} as detailed in Chapter \ref{chap:api_rsvd_keys} - i.e., they are to be available at client start of execution and are subject to the retrieval rules of Section \ref{chap:rkeys:retrules}. Examples for retrieving fabric-related information include retrieval of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An array of information on fabric devices for a node by passing \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICES} as the key to \refapi{PMIx_Get} along with the \refattr{PMIX_HOSTNAME} of the node as a directive

    \item An array of information on a specific fabric device by passing \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE} as the key to \refapi{PMIx_Get} along with the \refattr{PMIX_DEVICE_ID} of the device as a directive

    \item An array of information on a specific fabric device by passing \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE} as the key to \refapi{PMIx_Get} along with both \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_NAME} of the device and the \refattr{PMIX_HOSTNAME} of the node as directives
\end{itemize}

When requesting data on a device, returned data must include at least the following attributes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \pasteAttributeItemBegin{PMIX_HOSTNAME} The \refattr{PMIX_NODEID} may be returned in its place, or in addition to the hostname.
    \pasteAttributeItemEnd
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_DEVICE_ID}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_NAME}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_VENDOR}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_BUS_TYPE}
    \item \pasteAttributeItemBegin{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_PCI_DEVID} This item should be included if the device bus type is \ac{PCI} - the equivalent should be provided for any other bus type.
    \pasteAttributeItemEnd
\end{itemize}

The returned array may optionally contain one or more of the following in addition to the above list:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_INDEX}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_VENDORID}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_DRIVER}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_FIRMWARE}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_ADDRESS}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_COORDINATES}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_MTU}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_SPEED}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_STATE}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE_TYPE}
\end{itemize}

%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATED}
The \ac{PMIx} server library has completed updating the entries of all affected \refstruct{pmix_fabric_t} objects registered with the library. Access to the entries of those objects may now resume.
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATE_ENDPOINTS}
Endpoint assignments have been updated, usually in response to migration
or restart of a process. Clients should use \refapi{PMIx_Get} to update any
internally cached connections.
%
\end{constantdesc}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Fabric Support Datatypes}

Several datatype definitions have been created to support fabric-related operations and information.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Fabric Endpoint Structure}
\declarestruct{pmix_endpoint_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_endpoint_t} structure contains an assigned endpoint for a given fabric device.

\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

The \refarg{uuid} field contains the \ac{UUID} of the fabric device, the \refarg{osname} is the local operating system's name for the device, and the \refarg{endpt} field contains a fabric vendor-specific object identifying the communication endpoint assigned to the process.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Fabric Coordinate Structure}
\declarestruct{pmix_coord_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_coord_t} structure describes the fabric coordinates of a specified device in a given view.

\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}
typedef struct pmix_coord \{
    pmix_coord_view_t view;
    uint32_t *coord;
    size_t dims;
\} pmix_coord_t;
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

All coordinate values shall be expressed as unsigned integers due to their units being defined in fabric devices and not physical distances. The coordinate is therefore an indicator of connectivity and not relative communication distance.

\adviceimplstart
Note that the \refstruct{pmix_coord_t} structure does not imply nor mandate any requirement on how the coordinate data is to be stored within the \ac{PMIx} library. Implementers are free to store the coordinate in whatever format they choose.
\adviceimplend

A fabric coordinate is associated with a given fabric device and must be unique within a given view. Fabric devices are associated with the operating system which hosts them - thus, fabric coordinates are logically grouped within the \emph{node} realm (as described in Section \ref{api:struct:attributes:retrieval}) and can be retrieved per the rules detailed in Section \ref{chap:res:nrealm}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    char *osname;

    size_t ncoords;
\} pmix_geometry_t;
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

All coordinate values shall be expressed as unsigned integers due to their units being defined in fabric devices and not physical distances. The coordinate is therefore an indicator of connectivity and not relative communication distance.

Note that the \refstruct{pmix_coord_t} structure does not imply nor mandate any requirement on how the coordinate data is to be stored within the \ac{PMIx} library. Implementers are free to store the coordinate in whatever format they choose.

\subsection{Fabric Coordinate Views}
\declarestruct{pmix_coord_view_t}

\versionMarker{4.0}
\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}

#define PMIX_COORD_PHYSICAL_VIEW    0x02
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

Note that in this structure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \refarg{name} is an optional user-supplied string name identifying the fabric being referenced by this struct. If provided, the field must be a \code{NULL}-terminated string composed of standard alphanumeric values supported by common utilities such as \textit{strcmp}.;

\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_FABRIC_SHAPE_STRING}

While unusual due to scaling issues, implementations may include an array of \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_DEVICE} elements describing the device information for each device in the overall system. Each element shall contain a \refstruct{pmix_data_array_t} of \refstruct{pmix_info_t} values describing the device. Each array may contain one or more of the following (ordering is arbitrary):

\section{Fabric Support Attributes}
\label{api:fabric:attrs}

The following attribute is used by the \ac{PMIx} server library supporting the system's \ac{WLM} to indicate that it wants access to the fabric support functions:

\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_SERVER_SCHEDULER}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
The following attributes may be returned in response to fabric-specific \acp{API} or queries (e.g., \refapi{PMIx_Get} or \refapi{PMIx_Query_info}). These attributes are not related to a specific \refterm{data realm} (as described in Section \ref{api:struct:attributes:retrieval}) - the \refapi{PMIx_Get} function shall therefore ignore the value in its \refarg{proc} process identifier argument when retrieving these values.

%
\declareAttributeNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_COST_MATRIX}{"pmix.fab.cm"}{pointer}{
Pointer to a two-dimensional square array of point-to-point relative communication costs expressed as \code{uint16_t} values.
}
%
\declareAttributeNEW{PMIX_FABRIC_GROUPS}{"pmix.fab.grps"}{string}{
A string delineating the group membership of nodes in the overall system, where each fabric group consists of the group number followed by a colon and a comma-delimited list of nodes in that group, with the groups delimited by semi-colons (e.g., \code{0:node000,node002,node004,node006;\allowbreak 1:node001,node003,\allowbreak node005,node007})

\section{Fabric Support Functions}

The following \acp{API} allow the \ac{WLM} to request specific services from the fabric subsystem via the \ac{PMIx} library.

\advicermstart
Due to their high cost in terms of execution, memory consumption, and interactions with other \ac{SMS} components (e.g., a fabric manager), it is strongly advised that the underlying implementation of these \acp{API} be restricted to a single \ac{PMIx} server in a system that is supporting the \ac{SMS} component responsible for the scheduling of allocations (i.e., the system \refterm{scheduler}). The \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_SCHEDULER} attribute can be used for this purpose to control the execution path. Clients, tools, and other servers utilizing these functions are advised to have their requests forwarded to the server supporting the scheduler using the \refapi{pmix_server_fabric_fn_t} server module function, as needed.

%%%%
\descr

Register for access to fabric-related information, including the communication cost matrix. This call must be made prior to requesting information from a fabric. The caller may request access to a particular fabric using the vendor, type, or identifier, or to a specific \refterm{fabric plane} via the \refattr{PMIX_FABRIC_PLANE} attribute - otherwise, information for the default fabric will be returned. Upon successful completion of the call, information will have been filled into the fields of the provided \refarg{fabric} structure.

For performance reasons, the \ac{PMIx} library does not provide thread protection for accessing the information in the \refstruct{pmix_fabric_t} structure. Instead, the \ac{PMIx} implementation shall provide two methods for coordinating updates to the provided fabric information:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Users may periodically poll for updates using the \refapi{PMIx_Fabric_update} \ac{API}

    \item Users may register for \refconst{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATE_PENDING} events indicating that an update to the cost matrix is pending. When received, users are required to terminate or pause any actions involving access to the cost matrix before returning from the event. Completion of the \refconst{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATE_PENDING} event handler indicates to the \ac{PMIx} library that the fabric object's entries are available for updating. This may include releasing and re-allocating memory as the number of vertices may have changed (e.g., due to addition or removal of one or more devices). When the update has been completed, the \ac{PMIx} library will generate a \refconst{PMIX_FABRIC_UPDATED} event indicating that it is safe to begin using the updated fabric object(s).

\end{itemize}

There is no requirement that the caller exclusively use either one of these options. For example, the user may choose to both register for fabric update events, but poll for an update prior to some critical operation.
