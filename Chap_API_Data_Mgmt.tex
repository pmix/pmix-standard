\chapter{Data Packing and Unpacking}
\label{chap:api_data_mgmt}

\ac{PMIx} intentionally does not include support for internode communications in the standard, instead relying on its host \ac{SMS} environment to transfer any needed data and/or requests between nodes.  However, to support \ac{SMS} environments which must frequently transfer \ac{PMIx} data structures between nodes and client applications that need to store or transfer \ac{PMIx} data structures, \ac{PMIx} provides the \acs{API} presented in this chapter. These operations frequently involve PMIx-defined data structures that include data that may have different binary representations on different hosts. Many \ac{HPC} clusters are homogeneous, and so transferring the structures can be done rather simply. However, greater effort is required in heterogeneous environments to ensure binary data is correctly transferred. \ac{PMIx} buffer manipulation functions are provided for this purpose via standardized interfaces to ease adoption.

Load the given data into the provided \refstruct{pmix_data_buffer_t} object, usually done in preparation for unpacking the provided data. Note that the data is \textit{not} copied into the buffer - thus, the blob must not be released until after operations on the buffer have completed.

Unload the data from a \refstruct{pmix_data_buffer_t} object.
Extract the data in a buffer, assigning the pointer to the data (and the number of bytes in the blob) to the provided variables, usually done to transmit the blob to a remote process for unpacking. The buffer's internal pointer will be set to NULL to protect the data upon buffer destruct or release - thus, the user is responsible for releasing the blob when done with it.

\argin{num_vals}{Number of elements pointed to by the \refarg{src} pointer. A string value is counted as a single value regardless of length. The values must be contiguous in memory. Arrays of pointers (e.g., string arrays) should be contiguous, although the data pointed to need not be contiguous across array entries.(\code{int32_t})}

\end{constantdesc}

%%%%
\descr

The pack function packs one or more values of a specified type into the specified buffer.  The buffer must have already been
initialized via the \refmacro{PMIX_DATA_BUFFER_CREATE} or \refmacro{PMIX_DATA_BUFFER_CONSTRUCT}
macros --- otherwise, \refapi{PMIx_Data_pack} will return an error.  
The buffer may have already contain packed data, in which case the new data is appended to the buffer.
Providing an unsupported type flag will likewise be reported as an error.

Note that packing data using a type that 
does not explicitly specifies its size may
may lose precision when unpacked
by a non-homogeneous recipient.  The \refapi{PMIx_Data_pack} function will do its best to deal
with heterogeneity issues between the packer and unpacker in such
cases. Sending a value larger than can be handled by the recipient
will return an error code (generated upon unpacking) ---
the error cannot be detected during packing.

The namespace of the intended recipient of the packed buffer (i.e., the
process that will be unpacking it) is used solely to resolve any data type
differences between \ac{PMIx} versions. The recipient must, therefore, be
known to the user prior to calling the pack function so that the
\ac{PMIx} library is aware of the version the recipient is using. Note that
all processes in a given namespace are \textit{required} to use the same \ac{PMIx}
version --- thus, the caller must only know at least one process from the
target's namespace.

\arginout{max_num_values}{The number of values to be unpacked.  Upon completion, the parameter will be set to the actual number of values unpacked. In most cases, this should match the maximum number provided in the parameters, but in no case will it exceed the value of this parameter.  Note that unpacking fewer values than are actually available will leave the buffer in an unpackable state and the function will return an error code to warn of this condition.(\code{int32_t})}

%%%%
\descr

The unpack function unpacks the next value (or values) from the given buffer. Providing an unsupported type flag 
or specifying a data type that \textit{does not} match the type of the next item in the buffer will be reported as an error. 
An attempt to read an uninitialized buffer or read beyond the end of the stored data held in the buffer will also return an error.

Unpacking values is a "nondestructive" process --- i.e., the values are not removed from the buffer. It is therefore possible for the caller to re-unpack a value from the same buffer by resetting the unpack_ptr.

Warning: The caller is responsible for providing adequate memory storage for the requested data. The user must provide a parameter indicating the maximum number of values that can be unpacked into the allocated memory. If more values exist in the buffer than can fit into the memory storage, then the function will unpack what it can fit into that location and return an error code indicating that the buffer was only partially unpacked.

Note that any data that is packed using a type that does not explicitly specifies its size may lose precision when unpacked by a non-homogeneous recipient. \ac{PMIx} will do its best to deal with heterogeneity issues between the packer and unpacker in such cases. Sending a number larger than can be handled by the recipient will return an error code generated upon unpacking --- these errors cannot be detected during packing.

The namespace of the process that packed the buffer is used solely to resolve any data type
differences between \ac{PMIx} versions. The packer must, therefore, be
known to the caller prior to calling the unpack function so that the
\ac{PMIx} library is aware of the version the packer used. Note that
all processes in a given namespace are \textit{required} to use the same \ac{PMIx}
version --- thus the target rank may be set to \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD}.

This function will append a copy of the payload in one buffer into another buffer.

The unload function provides the caller with a pointer to the
portion of the data payload within the buffer that has not yet been
unpacked, along with the size of that region. Any portion of
the payload that was previously unpacked using the \refapi{PMIx_Data_unpack}
routine will not be included in the unload operation. This operation allows the user to directly access the payload of a \refstruct{pmix_data_buffer_t}.

\adviceuserstart
This is a destructive operation. While the payload returned in the
destination \refstruct{pmix_byte_object_t} is
undisturbed, the function will clear the \refarg{src}'s pointers to the
payload. Thus, the \refarg{src} and the payload are completely separated,
leaving the caller able to free or destruct the \refarg{src}.

%%%%
\descr

The load function allows the caller to transfer the contents of the \refarg{src}
\refstruct{pmix_byte_object_t} to the \refarg{dest} target buffer. If a payload
already exists in the buffer, the function will "free" the existing data to
release it, and then replace the data payload with the one provided
by the caller.

\adviceuserstart
The buffer must be allocated or constructed in advance - failing to do so
will cause the load function to return an error code.

The caller is responsible for pre-packing the provided
payload. For example, the load function cannot convert to network byte order
any data contained in the provided payload.

Only data compressed by the \refapi{PMIx_Data_compress} \ac{API}
