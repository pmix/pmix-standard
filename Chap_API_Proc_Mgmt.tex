This chapter defines functionality processes can use to abort processes, spawn processes, and determine the relative locality of local processes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Abort}
\label{chap:api_proc_mgmt:abort}

\ac{PMIx} provides a dedicated API by which an application can request that specified processes be aborted by the system.

\end{arglist}

Returns \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} or a negative value corresponding to a PMIx error constant.

%%%%
\descr

Request that the host resource manager print the provided message and abort the provided array of \refarg{procs}.
A Unix or POSIX environment should handle the provided status as a return error code from the main program that launched the application.
A \code{NULL} for the \refarg{procs} array indicates that all processes in the caller's namespace are to be aborted, including itself.
Passing a \code{NULL} \refarg{msg} parameter is allowed.

The function shall not return until the host environment has carried out the operation on the specified processes. If the caller is included in the array of targets, then the function will not return unless the host is unable to execute the operation.

\adviceuserstart
The response to this request is somewhat dependent on the specific \acl{RM} and its configuration (e.g., some resource managers will not abort the application if the provided status is zero unless specifically configured to do so, and some cannot abort subsets of processes in an application), and thus lies outside the control of PMIx itself.
However, the PMIx client library shall inform the \ac{RM} of the request that the specified \refarg{procs} be aborted, regardless of the value of the provided status.

Note that race conditions caused by multiple processes calling \refapi{PMIx_Abort} are left to the server implementation to resolve with regard to which status is returned and what messages (if any) are printed.

\section{Process Creation}
\label{chap:api_proc_mgmt:spawn}

\descr

Spawn a new job.
The assigned namespace of the spawned applications is returned in the \refarg{nspace} parameter.
A \code{NULL} value in that location indicates that the caller doesn't wish to have the namespace returned.
The \refarg{nspace} array must be at least of size one more than \refconst{PMIX_MAX_NSLEN}.

By default, the spawned processes will be PMIx ``connected'' to the parent process upon successful launch (see Section \ref{chap:api_proc_mgmt:connect}
for details). This includes that (a) the parent process will be given a copy of the new job's
information so it can query job-level info without incurring any communication penalties, (b) newly spawned child processes will receive a copy of the parent processes job-level info, and (c) both the parent process and members of the child job will receive notification of errors from processes in their combined assemblage.

\adviceuserstart
Behavior of individual resource managers may differ, but it is expected that failure of any application process to start will result in termination/cleanup of all processes in the newly spawned job and return of an error code to the caller.
\adviceuserend

\adviceimplstart
Tools may utilize \refapi{PMIx_Spawn} to start intermediate launchers as described in Section \ref{chap:api_tools:indirect}. For times where the tool is not attached to a \ac{PMIx} server, internal support for fork/exec of the specified applications would allow the tool to maintain a single code path for both the connected and disconnected cases. Inclusion of such support is recommended, but not required.

\subsection{Spawn attributes}
\label{api:struct:attributes:spawn}

Attributes used to describe \refapi{PMIx_Spawn} behavior - they are values passed to the \refapi{PMIx_Spawn} \ac{API} and therefore are not accessed using the \refapi{PMIx_Get} \acp{API} when used in that context. However, some of the attributes defined in this section can be provided by the host environment for other purposes - e.g., the host might provide the \refattr{PMIX_MAPPER} attribute in the job-related information so that an application can use \refapi{PMIx_Get} to discover the layout algorithm used for determining process locations.

\section{Connecting and Disconnecting Processes}
\label{chap:api_proc_mgmt:connect}

This section defines functions to connect and disconnect processes in two or more separate \ac{PMIx} namespaces. The \ac{PMIx} definition of \textit{connected} solely implies that the host environment should treat the failure of any process in the assemblage as a reportable event, taking action on the assemblage as if it were a single application. For example, if the environment defaults (in the absence of any application directives) to terminating an application upon failure of any process in that application, then the environment should terminate all processes in the connected assemblage upon failure of any member.

The host environment may choose to assign a new namespace to the connected assemblage and/or assign new ranks for its members for its own internal tracking purposes. However, it is not required to communicate such assignments to the participants (e.g., in response to an appropriate call to \refapi{PMIx_Query_info_nb}). The host environment is required to generate a \refconst{PMIX_ERR_PROC_TERM_WO_SYNC} event should any process in the assemblage terminate or call \refapi{PMIx_Finalize} without first \textit{disconnecting} from the assemblage. If the job including the process is terminated as a result of that action, then the host environment is required to also generate the \refconst{PMIX_ERR_JOB_TERM_WO_SYNC} for all jobs that were terminated as a result.

\advicermstart
The \textit{connect} operation does not require the exchange of job-level information nor the inclusion of information posted by  participating processes via \refapi{PMIx_Put}. Indeed, the callback function utilized in \refapi{pmix_server_connect_fn_t} cannot pass information back into the \ac{PMIx} server library. However, host environments are advised that collecting such information at the participating daemons represents an optimization opportunity as participating processes are likely to request such information after the connect operation completes.
\advicermend

\adviceuserstart
Attempting to \textit{connect} processes solely within the same namespace is essentially a \textit{no-op} operation. While not explicitly prohibited, users are advised that a \ac{PMIx} implementation or host environment may return an error in such cases.

Neither the \ac{PMIx} implementation nor host environment are required to provide any tracking support for the assemblage. Thus, the application is responsible for maintaining the membership list of the assemblage.

\section{Process Locality}
\label{chap:api_proc_mgmt:locality}

The relative locality of processes is often used to optimize their interactions with the hardware and other processes. \ac{PMIx} provides a means by which the host environment can communicate the locality of a given process using the \refapi{PMIx_server_generate_locality_string} to generate an abstracted representation of that value. This provides a human-readable format and allows the client to parse the locality string with a method of its choice that may differ from the one used by the server that generated it.

There are times, however, when relative locality and other \ac{PMIx}-provided
information doesn't include some element required by the application. In these
instances, the application may need access to the full description of the
local hardware topology. \ac{PMIx} does not itself generate such descriptions
- there are multiple third-party libraries that fulfill that role. Instead,
\ac{PMIx} offers an abstraction method by which users can obtain a pointer to
the description. This transparently enables support for different methods of
sharing the topology between the host environment (which may well have already
generated it prior to local start of application processes) and the clients -
e.g., through passing of a shared memory region.

implementation or else indicate that the implementation is not available by

The returned pointer may point to a shared memory region or an actual instance
of the topology description. In either case, the description shall be treated
as a "read-only" object - attempts to modify the object are likely to fail and
return an error. The \ac{PMIx} library is responsible for performing any required cleanup when the client library finalizes.

\adviceuserstart
It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the \refarg{topo} argument
