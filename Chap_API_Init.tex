\chapter{Initialization and Finalization}
\label{chap:api_init}

The \ac{PMIx} \acp{API} may only be used between the completion of the initialization function and the start of the finalization function, unless otherwise noted.
The initialization and finalization functions are paired, and the initialized regions defined by them must not overlap.

Consumers of the \ac{PMIx} \acp{API} are grouped into three categories based on the role they wish to play in the \ac{PMIx} environment: \emph{clients}, \emph{servers}, and \emph{tools}.
As a result, there are three corresponding sets of initialization and finalization functions.
If a process initializes as either a \emph{server} or a \emph{tool} that process may also access all of the \emph{client} \acp{API}.

A process operating as a \emph{client} is started (directly or indirectly, for example, by an intermediate script) by the \ac{RM} and is connected to the \ac{PMIx} server instance within that \ac{RM} when the client calls the client \ac{PMIx} initialization routine.
A process operating as a \emph{server} is responsible for starting client processes and coordinating with other server and tool processes in the same \ac{PMIx} universe.
Often processes operating as a \emph{server} are part of the \acf{RM} infrastructure.
A process operating as a \emph{tool} will connect to a \ac{PMIx} \emph{server} to interact with the processes in the \ac{PMIx} universe.
An example of a \emph{tool} process is a parallel debugger that will connect to the server to assist with attaching to a set of client processes.

\ac{PMIx} serves as a conduit between processes acting in these three different roles.
As such, an \ac{API} is often described in how it interacts with processes operating in other roles in the \ac{PMIx} universe.

\adviceimplstart
A \ac{PMIx} implementation may support all or a subset of the \ac{API} role groupings defined in the standard.
A common nomenclature is defined here to aid in identifying levels of conformance of an implementation.

A \ac{PMIx} implementation that supports all three sets of the \ac{API} role groupings is said to be \emph{fully \ac{PMIx} standard compliant}.
These \emph{fully \ac{PMIx} standard compliant} implementations have the advantage of being able to support a broad set of \ac{PMIx} consumers in the different roles.

Alternatively, a \ac{PMIx} implementation may choose to support fewer than all three sets of the \ac{API} role groupings.
\ac{PMIx} implementations that support only the \emph{client} \acp{API} are said to be \emph{client-only \ac{PMIx} standard compliant}.
Similarly, an implementation that only supports the \emph{client} and \emph{tool} \acp{API} are said to be \emph{client-and-tool-only \ac{PMIx} standard compliant}.
Finally, an implementation that only supports the \emph{client} and \emph{server} \acp{API} are said to be \emph{client-and-server-only \ac{PMIx} standard compliant}.
Note that it would not make sense for an implementation to exclude the \emph{client} interfaces from their implementation since they are also used by the \emph{server} and \emph{tool} roles.

Initialize the \ac{PMIx} client, returning the process identifier assigned to this client's application in the provided \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} struct.
Passing a value of \code{NULL} for this parameter is allowed if the user wishes solely to initialize the \ac{PMIx} system and does not require return of the identifier at that time.

When called, the \ac{PMIx} client shall check for the required connection information of the associated \ac{PMIx} server and establish the connection.
If the information is not found, or the server connection fails, then an appropriate error constant shall be returned.

If successful, the function shall return \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} and fill the \refarg{proc} structure (if provided) with the server-assigned namespace and rank of the process within the application.
In addition, all startup information provided by the resource manager shall be made available to the client process via subsequent calls to \refapi{PMIx_Get}.

The \ac{PMIx} client library shall be reference counted, and so multiple calls to \refapi{PMIx_Init} are allowed by the standard.
Thus, one way for an application process to obtain its namespace and rank is to simply call \refapi{PMIx_Init} with a non-NULL \refarg{proc} parameter.
Note that each call to \refapi{PMIx_Init} must be balanced with a call to \refapi{PMIx_Finalize} to maintain the reference count.

Each call to \refapi{PMIx_Init} may contain an array of \refstruct{pmix_info_t} structures passing directives to the \ac{PMIx} client library as per the above attributes.
Multiple calls to \refapi{PMIx_Init} shall not include conflicting directives.
The \refapi{PMIx_Init} function will return an error when directives that conflict with prior directives are detected.

\adviceuserstart
The \ac{PMIx} \textit{ad hoc} v1.0 Standard defined the \refapi{PMIx_Init} function, but modified the function signature in the v1.2 version. The \textit{ad hoc} v1.0 version of \refapi{PMIx_Init} is not included in this document to avoid confusion.

\descr

Initialize the \ac{PMIx} tool, returning the process identifier assigned to this tool in the provided \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} struct. The \refarg{info} array is used to pass user requests pertaining to the initialization and subsequent operations. Passing a \code{NULL} value for the array pointer is supported if no directives are desired.

If called with the \refattr{PMIX_TOOL_DO_NOT_CONNECT} attribute, the \ac{PMIx} tool library will fully initialize but not attempt to connect to a \ac{PMIx} server. The tool can connect to a server at a later point in time, if desired, by calling the \refapi{PMIx_tool_connect_to_server} function. In all other cases, the \ac{PMIx} tool library will attempt to connect to a \ac{PMIx} server according to the following precedence chain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item if \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_URI} or \refattr{PMIX_TCP_URI} is given, then connection will be attempted to the server at the specified \ac{URI}. Note that it is an error for both of these attributes to be specified. \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_URI} is the preferred method as it is more generalized --- \refattr{PMIX_TCP_URI} is provided for those cases where the user specifically wants to use a TCP transport for the connection and wants to error out if it is not available or cannot succeed. The \ac{PMIx} library will return an error if connection fails --- it will not proceed to check for other connection options as the user specified a particular one to use
    \item if \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_PIDINFO} was provided, then the tool will search under the directory provided by the \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_TMPDIR} environmental variable for a rendezvous file created by the process corresponding to that \ac{PID}. The \ac{PMIx} library will return an error if the rendezvous file cannot be found, or the connection is refused by the server
    \item if \refattr{PMIX_CONNECT_TO_SYSTEM} is given, then the tool will search for a system-level rendezvous file created by a \ac{PMIx} server in the directory specified by the \refattr{PMIX_SYSTEM_TMPDIR} environmental variable. If found, then the tool will attempt to connect to it. An error is returned if the rendezvous file cannot be found or the connection is refused.
    \item if \refattr{PMIX_CONNECT_SYSTEM_FIRST} is given, then the tool will search for a system-level rendezvous file created by a \ac{PMIx} server in the directory specified by the \refattr{PMIX_SYSTEM_TMPDIR} environmental variable. If found, then the tool will attempt to connect to it. In this case, no error will be returned if the rendezvous file is not found or connection is refused --- the \ac{PMIx} library will silently continue to the next option
    \item lastly and by default, the tool will search the directory tree under the directory provided by the \refattr{PMIX_SERVER_TMPDIR} environmental variable for rendezvous files of \ac{PMIx} servers, attempting to connect to each it finds until one accepts the connection. If no rendezvous files are found, or all contacted servers refuse connection, then the \ac{PMIx} library will return an error.
\end{itemize}

If successful, the function will return \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} and will fill the provided process structure (if provided) with the server-assigned namespace and rank of the tool. Note that each connection attempt in the above precedence chain will retry (with delay between each retry) a number of times according to the values of the corresponding attributes. Default is no retries.

Note that the \ac{PMIx} tool library is referenced counted, and so multiple calls to \refapi{PMIx_tool_init} are allowed.
Thus, one way to obtain the namespace and rank of the process is to simply call \refapi{PMIx_tool_init} with a non-NULL parameter.

Closes the connection, if existing, to a server and establishes a connection to the specified server.
This function can be called at any time by a \ac{PMIx} tool to shift connections between servers.
The process identifier assigned to this tool is returned in the provided \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} struct.
Passing a value of \code{NULL} for this parameter is allowed if the user wishes solely to connect to the \ac{PMIx} server and does not require return of the identifier at that time.

\adviceimplstart
\ac{PMIx} tools and clients are prohibited from being connected to more than one server at a time to avoid confusion in subsystems such as event notification.

When a tool connects to a server that is under a different namespace manager (e.g., host \ac{RM}) as the prior server, the identifier of the tool must remain unique in the namespaces. This may require the identifier of the tool to be changed on-the-fly, that is, the \refarg{proc} parameter would be filled (if non-NULL) with a different nspace/rank from the current tool identifier.
\adviceimplend

\adviceuserstart
Passing a \code{NULL} value for the \refarg{info} pointer is not allowed and will result in returning an error.

Some \ac{PMIx} implementations may not support connecting to a server that is not under the same namespace manager (e.g., host \ac{RM}) as the tool.
