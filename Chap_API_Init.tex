\chapter{Client Initialization and Finalization}
\label{chap:api_init}

The \ac{PMIx} library is required to be initialized and finalized around the usage of most \ac{PMIx} functions or macros.
The \acp{API} that may be used outside of the initialized and finalized region are noted.
All other \acp{API} must be used inside this region.

There are three sets of initialization and finalization functions depending upon the role of the process in the \ac{PMIx} Standard - those associated with the \ac{PMIx} \refterm{client} are defined in this chapter. Similar functions corresponding to the roles of \emph{server} and \emph{tool} are defined in Chapters \ref{chap:api_server} and \ref{chap:api_tools}, respectively.

Note that a process can only call \textit{one} of the initialization/finalization functional pairs from the set of three - e.g., a process that calls the client initialization function cannot also call the tool or server initialization functions, and must call the corresponding client finalization function. Regardless of the role assumed by the process, all processes have access to the client \acp{API}. Thus, the \emph{server} and \emph{tool} roles can be considered supersets of the \ac{PMIx} client.

\section{\code{PMIx_Initialized}}
\declareapi{PMIx_Initialized}

%%%%
\summary

Determine if the \ac{PMIx} library has been initialized. This function may be used outside of the initialized and finalized region, and is usable by servers and tools in addition to clients.

%%%%
\format

\versionMarker{1.0}
\cspecificstart
\begin{codepar}
int PMIx_Initialized(void)
\end{codepar}
\cspecificend

A value of \code{1} (true) will be returned if the \ac{PMIx} library has been initialized, and \code{0} (false) otherwise.

\rationalestart
The return value is an integer for historical reasons as that was the signature of prior PMI libraries.
\rationaleend

Check to see if the \ac{PMIx} library has been initialized using any of the init functions:
\refapi{PMIx_Init}, \refapi{PMIx_server_init}, or \refapi{PMIx_tool_init}.

%%%%
\descr

Initialize the \ac{PMIx} client, returning the process identifier assigned to this client's application in the provided \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} struct.
Passing a value of \code{NULL} for this parameter is allowed if the user wishes solely to initialize the \ac{PMIx} system and does not require return of the identifier at that time.

When called, the \ac{PMIx} client shall check for the required connection information of the local \ac{PMIx} server and establish the connection.
If the information is not found, or the server connection fails, then an appropriate error constant shall be returned.

If successful, the function shall return \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} and fill the \refarg{proc} structure (if provided) with the server-assigned namespace and rank of the process within the application.
In addition, all startup information provided by the resource manager shall be made available to the client process via subsequent calls to \refapi{PMIx_Get}.

The \ac{PMIx} client library shall be reference counted, and so multiple calls to \refapi{PMIx_Init} are allowed by the standard.
Thus, one way for an application process to obtain its namespace and rank is to simply call \refapi{PMIx_Init} with a non-NULL \refarg{proc} parameter.
Note that each call to \refapi{PMIx_Init} must be balanced with a call to \refapi{PMIx_Finalize} to maintain the reference count.

Each call to \refapi{PMIx_Init} may contain an array of \refstruct{pmix_info_t} structures passing directives to the \ac{PMIx} client library as per the above attributes.

Multiple calls to \refapi{PMIx_Init} shall not include conflicting directives.
The \refapi{PMIx_Init} function will return an error when directives that conflict with prior directives are encountered.

\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_EMBED_BARRIER}
\optattrend

%%%%

\subsection{Finalize attributes}

The following attribute influences the behavior of \refapi{PMIx_Finalize}.

%
\declareAttribute{PMIX_EMBED_BARRIER}{"pmix.embed.barrier"}{bool}{
Execute a blocking fence operation before executing the specified operation.
\refapi{PMIx_Finalize} does not include an internal barrier operation by default.
