\chapter{Use-Cases}
\label{app:use-cases}

The \ac{PMIx} standard provides many generic interfaces that can be composed into higher-level use cases in a variety of ways.  While the specific interfaces and attributes are standardized, the use cases themselves are not (and should not) be standardized.  Common use cases are included here as examples of how PMIx's generic interfaces \texttt{might} be composed together for a higher-level purpose. The use cases are intended for both \ac{PMIx} interface users and library implementors.  Wherby a better understanding of the general usage model within the community can help users picking up PMIx for the first and help implementors optimize their implementation for the common cases.

Each use case is structured to provide background information about the high-level use case as well as specific details about how the PMIx interfaces are used within the use case.  Some use cases even provide code snippets.  These code snippets are apart of larger code examples located within the standard's source code repository, and each complete code example is fully compilable and runnable. The related interfaces and attributes collected at the bottom of each use case are mainly for conveinence and link to the full standardized definitions.
