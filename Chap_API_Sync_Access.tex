\chapter{Synchronization and Data Access Operations}
\label{chap:api_sync_acc}

Applications may need to synchronize their operations at various points in
their execution. Depending on a variety of factors (e.g., the programming
model and where the synchronization point lies), the application may choose to
execute the operation using \ac{PMIx}. This is particularly useful in
situations where communication by other means is not yet available since
\ac{PMIx} relies on the host environment's infrastructure for such operations.

Synchronization operations also offer an opportunity for processes to exchange
data at a known point in their execution. Where required, this can include
information on communication endpoints for subsequent wireup of various
messaging protocols.

This chapter covers both the synchronization and data retrieval functions
provided under the \ac{PMIx} Standard.

%%%%
\descr

Passing a \code{NULL} pointer as the \refarg{procs} parameter indicates that the fence is to span all processes in the client's namespace.
Each provided \refstruct{pmix_proc_t} struct can pass \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD} to indicate that all processes in the given namespace are participating.

The \refarg{info} array is used to pass user directives regarding the behavior of the fence operation. Note that for scalability reasons, the default behavior for \refapi{PMIx_Fence} is to not collect data posted by the operation's participants.

\adviceimplstart
\refapi{PMIx_Fence} and its non-blocking form are both \emph{collective} operations. Accordingly, the \ac{PMIx} server library is required to aggregate participation by local clients, passing the request to the host environment once all local participants have executed the \ac{API}.
\adviceimplend

\advicermstart
The host will receive a single call for each collective operation. It is the responsibility of the host to identify the nodes containing participating processes, execute the collective across all participating nodes, and notify the local \ac{PMIx} server library upon completion of the global collective.

The following attributes are defined for use by retrieval \acp{API}:

%
\declareAttribute{PMIX_OPTIONAL}{"pmix.optional"}{bool}{
Look only in the client's local data store for the requested value - do not request data from the \ac{PMIx} server if not found.
}
%
\declareAttribute{PMIX_IMMEDIATE}{"pmix.immediate"}{bool}{
Specified operation should immediately return an error from the \ac{PMIx} server if the requested data cannot be found - do not request it from the host \ac{RM}.
}
%
\declareAttributeNEW{PMIX_GET_POINTER_VALUES}{"pmix.get.pntrs"}{bool}{
Request that any pointers in the returned value point directly to values in the key-value store. The user \emph{must not} release any returned data pointers.
}
%
\declareAttributeNEW{PMIX_GET_STATIC_VALUES}{"pmix.get.static"}{bool}{
Request that the data be returned in the provided storage location. The caller is responsible for destructing the \refstruct{pmix_value_t} using the \refmacro{PMIX_VALUE_DESTRUCT} macro when done.
}
%
\declareAttributeNEW{PMIX_GET_REFRESH_CACHE}{"pmix.get.refresh"}{bool}{
When retrieving data for a remote process, refresh the existing local data cache for the process in case new values have been put and committed by the process since the last refresh. Local process information is assumed to be automatically updated upon posting by the process. A \code{NULL} key will cause all values associated with the process to be refreshed - otherwise, only the indicated key will be updated. A process rank of \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD} can be used to update job-related information in dynamic environments.

\section{Query}
\label{chap:api_proc_mgmt:query}

As the level of interaction between applications and the host \ac{SMS} grows, so too does the need for the application to query the \ac{SMS} regarding its capabilities and state information. \ac{PMIx} provides a generalized query interface for this purpose, along with a set of standardized attribute keys to support a range of requests. This includes requests to determine the status of scheduling queues and active allocations, the scope of \ac{API} and attribute support offered by the \ac{SMS}, namespaces of active jobs, location and information about a job's processes, and information regarding available resources.

An example use-case for the \refapi{PMIx_Query_info_nb} \ac{API} is to ensure clean job completion. Time-shared systems frequently impose maximum run times when assigning jobs to resource allocations. To shut down gracefully (e.g., to write a checkpoint before termination) it is necessary for an application to periodically query the resource manager for the time remaining in its allocation. This is especially true on systems for which allocation times may be shortened or lengthened from the original time limit. Many resource managers provide \acp{API} to dynamically obtain this information, but each \ac{API} is specific to the resource manager.

\ac{PMIx} supports this use-case by defining an attribute key (\refattr{PMIX_TIME_REMAINING}) that can be used with the \refapi{PMIx_Query_info_nb} interface to obtain the number of seconds remaining in the current job allocation. Note that one could alternatively use the \refapi{PMIx_Register_event_handler} \ac{API} to register for an event indicating incipient job termination, and then use the \refapi{PMIx_Job_control_nb} \ac{API} to request that the host \ac{SMS} generate an event a specified amount of time prior to reaching the maximum run time. \ac{PMIx} provides such alternate methods as a means of maximizing the probability of a host system supporting at least one method by which the application can obtain the desired service.

The following \acp{API} support query of various session and environment values.

Also can be used to query node-specific info such as the list of peers executing on a given node. The host environment is responsible for exercising appropriate access control on the information.

The returned \refarg{status} indicates if requested data was found or not. The returned \refarg{info} array will contain a \refattr{PMIX_QUERY_RESULTS} element for each query of the \refarg{queries} array. If qualifiers were included in the query, then the first element of each results array shall contain the \refattr{PMIX_QUERY_QUALIFIERS} key with a \refstruct{pmix_data_array_t} containing the qualifiers. The remaining \refstruct{pmix_info_t} shall contain the results of the query, one entry for each key that was found.

\item a non-zero \ac{PMIx} error constant indicating a reason for the request to have been rejected. In this case, the provided callback function will not be executed.
\end{itemize}

If executed, the status returned in the provided callback function will be one of the following constants:

\begin{itemize}
\item \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} All data was found and has been returned.

\item \refconst{PMIX_ERR_NOT_FOUND} None of the requested data was available.
The \refarg{info} array will be \code{NULL} and \refarg{ninfo} zero.

\item \refconst{PMIX_ERR_PARTIAL_SUCCESS} Some of the requested data was found.
The \refarg{info} array shall contain an element for each query key that returned a value.

\item \refconst{PMIX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED} The host \ac{RM} does not support this function. The \refarg{info} array will be \code{NULL} and \refarg{ninfo} zero.

\item a non-zero \ac{PMIx} error constant indicating a reason for the request's failure. The \refarg{info} array will be \code{NULL} and \refarg{ninfo} zero.
\end{itemize}

\ac{PMIx} libraries and host environments that support this \ac{API} are required to support the following attributes:

\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_QUERY_REFRESH_CACHE}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_SESSION_INFO}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_JOB_INFO}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_APP_INFO}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_NODE_INFO}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_PROC_INFO}
\pasteAttributeItemBegin{PMIX_PROCID}In this context, specifies the process ID whose information is being requested - e.g., a query asking for the \refstruct{pmix_proc_info_t} of a specified process. Only required when the request is for information on a specific process.
\pasteAttributeItemEnd
\pasteAttributeItemBegin{PMIX_NSPACE}Specifies the namespace of the process whose information is being requested. Must be accompanied by the \refattr{PMIX_RANK} attribute. Only required when the request is for information on a specific process.
\pasteAttributeItemEnd
\pasteAttributeItemBegin{PMIX_RANK}Specifies the rank of the process whose information is being requested. Must be accompanied by the \refattr{PMIX_NSPACE} attribute. Only required when the request is for information on a specific process.
\pasteAttributeItemEnd
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_QUERY_ATTRIBUTE_SUPPORT}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTES}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_SERVER_ATTRIBUTES}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_HOST_ATTRIBUTES}
\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_TOOL_ATTRIBUTES}

Note that inclusion of both the \refattr{PMIX_PROCID} directive and either the \refattr{PMIX_NSPACE} or the \refattr{PMIX_RANK} attribute will return a \refconst{PMIX_ERR_BAD_PARAM} result, and that the inclusion of a process identifier must apply to all keys in that \refstruct{pmix_query_t}. Queries for information on multiple specific processes therefore requires submitting multiple \refstruct{pmix_query_t} structures, each referencing one process.

\ac{PMIx} libraries are not required to directly support any other attributes for this function. However, all provided attributes must be passed to the host \ac{SMS} daemon for processing. The \ac{PMIx} library is \textit{required} to add the \refAttributeItem{PMIX_USERID} and the \refAttributeItem{PMIX_GRPID} attributes of the client process making the request.

\section{Using Get vs Query}
\label{chap:api_job_mgmt:query}

Both \refapi{PMIx_Get} and \refapi{PMIx_Query_info} can be used to retrieve information about the system. In general, the \emph{get} operation should be used to retrieve:

\begin{itemize}
\item information provided by the host environment at time of job start. This includes information on the number of processes in the job, their location, and possibly their communication endpoints.
\item information posted by processes via the \refapi{PMIx_Put} function.
\end{itemize}

This information is largely considered to be \emph{static}, although this will not necessarily be true for environments supporting dynamic programming models or fault tolerance. Note that the \refapi{PMIx_Get} function only accesses information about execution environments - i.e., its scope is limited to values pertaining to a specific \refterm{session}, \refterm{job}, \refterm{application}, \refterm{process}, or \refterm{node}. It cannot be used to obtain information about areas such as the status of queues in the \ac{WLM}.

In contrast, the \emph{query} option should be used to access:

\begin{itemize}
\item system-level information (such as the available \ac{WLM} queues) that would generally not be included in job-level information provided at job start.
\item dynamic information such as application and queue status, and resource utilization statistics. Note that the \refattr{PMIX_QUERY_REFRESH_CACHE} attribute must be provided on each query to ensure current data is returned.
\item information created post job start, such as process tables.
\item information requiring more complex search criteria than supported by the simpler \refapi{PMIx_Get} \ac{API}.
\item queries focused on retrieving multi-attribute blocks of data with a single request, thus bypassing the single-key limitation of the \refapi{PMIx_Get} \ac{API}.
\end{itemize}

In theory, all information can be accessed via \refapi{PMIx_Query_info} as the local cache is typically the same datastore searched by \refapi{PMIx_Get}. However, in practice, the overhead associated with the \emph{query} operation may (depending upon implementation) be higher than the simpler \emph{get} operation due to the need to construct and process the more complex \refstruct{pmix_query_t} structure. Thus, requests for a single key value are likely to be accomplished faster with \refapi{PMIx_Get} versus the \emph{query} operation.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Accessing attribute support information}
\label{chap:api_job_mgmt:queryattrs}

Information as to which attributes are supported by either the \ac{PMIx} implementation or its host environment can be obtained via the \refapi{PMIx_Query_info} \acp{API}. The \refattr{PMIX_QUERY_ATTRIBUTE_SUPPORT} attribute must be listed as the first entry in the \refarg{keys} field of the \refstruct{pmix_query_t} structure, followed by the name of the function whose attribute support is being requested - support for multiple functions can be requested simultaneously by simply adding the function names to the array of \refarg{keys}. Function names \emph{must} be given as user-level \ac{API} names - e.g., ``PMIx_Get'', ``PMIx_server_setup_application'', or ``PMIx_tool_attach_to_server''.

The desired levels of attribute support are provided as qualifiers. Multiple levels can be requested simultaneously by simply adding elements to the \refarg{qualifiers} array. Each qualifier should contain the desired level attribute with the boolean value set to indicate whether or not that level is to be included in the returned information. Failure to provide any levels is equivalent to a request for all levels. Supported levels include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_CLIENT_FUNCTIONS}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_CLIENT_ATTRIBUTES}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_SERVER_FUNCTIONS}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_SERVER_ATTRIBUTES}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_HOST_FUNCTIONS}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_HOST_ATTRIBUTES}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_TOOL_FUNCTIONS}
    \item \pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_TOOL_ATTRIBUTES}
\end{itemize}

Unlike other queries, queries for attribute support can result in the number of returned \refstruct{pmix_info_t} structures being different from the number of queries. Each element in the returned array will correspond to a pair of specified attribute level and function in the query, where the \refarg{key} is the function and the \refarg{value} contains a \refstruct{pmix_data_array_t} of \refstruct{pmix_info_t}. Each element of the array is marked by a \refarg{key} indicating the requested attribute \emph{level} with a \refarg{value} composed of a \refstruct{pmix_data_array_t} of \refstruct{pmix_regattr_t}, each describing a supported attribute for that function, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:attrquery} below where the requestor asked for supported attributes of \refapi{PMIx_Get} at the \refarg{client} and \refarg{server} levels, plus attributes of \refapi{PMIx_Allocation_request} at all levels.

\begingroup
\begin{figure*}[ht!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[clip,width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/attrquery.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Returned information hierarchy for attribute support request}
  \label{fig:attrquery}
\end{figure*}
\endgroup

The array of returned structures, and their child arrays, are subject to the return rules for the \refapi{PMIx_Query_info_nb} \ac{API}. For example, a request for supported attributes of the \refapi{PMIx_Get} function that includes the \refarg{host} level will return values for the \refarg{client} and \refarg{server} levels, plus an array element with a \refarg{key} of \refattr{PMIX_HOST_ATTRIBUTES} and a value type of \refconst{PMIX_UNDEF} indicating that no attributes are supported at that level.
